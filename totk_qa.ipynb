      "Consolidated Context from ChromaDB: Ever since Link and Zelda had ventured below the Castle to investigate the Gloom, Hyrule had been a land without a ruler - desperately searching for any sign of its missing Princess. And, since the Upheaval, there was hope: reports of sightings of Zelda came in from all across the country - of the Princess visiting stables and villages, even Hyrule Castle itself. But when Link, and the Sages he had awakened from each of the four regions, had stormed the floating citadel, they had uncovered the truth: this was not Hyrule’s Princess, but Ganondorf himself: a phantom conjured by his power, designed to sabotage and manipulate Hyrule from the inside. Ganondorf’s puppet had been responsible for all of the regional phenomena, and had appeared at Hyrule Castle specifically to lure Link into a trap. And, this would have worked: Link would have once again fallen victim to the terrible Gloom, were it not for the intervention of the Sages. The mystery of the actual Princess Zelda’s disappearance had only grown deeper, but the truth of the Upheaval itself was now clear to everyone: it had been caused by the return of Ganondorf, the Demon King from the legend of the Imprisoning War. News of the Demon King’s return spread like wildfire - printed on the front page of newspapers, and muttered under the breath of stable owners. Link and the Sages convene with Purah at Lookout Landing to form a plan. They are all now aware of the identity of Puppet Zelda, and that the real Zelda must have travelled somehow to the distant past - as when each of them had awakened as a Sage, they had seen visions of the confrontation with Ganondorf, and of their predecessors talking to Princess Zelda. They know that Zelda had come up with a plan to defeat the Demon King - that they were destined to fight alongside Link now he has returned in the present day. But other than that, they don’t know anything about Ganondorf, his story or his goals, other than that he is “bad news and super strong.” Purah notices that, when the Sages told her of the visions they had seen of the distant past, there had been six sages supporting King Rauru in the battle: Wind, Fire, Water, Lightning, Time, but also Spirit: Mineru. Purah notes that each of the Sages present had awoken at ancient ruins from the time of King Rauru, and guesses that Mineru might be found in a similar place. The group splits up to search for clues: Tulin, Yunobo, Sidon and Riju return to their regions to hunt there, but Link instead heads towards the home of the Sheikah: Kakariko Village. Ever since the Upheaval, Zelda’s Zonai Survey Team had been investigating strange, ring-shaped ruins that had fallen directly on top of Kakariko Village. During Breath of the Wild, the chief of Kakariko Village had been Impa - a royal advisor to the King and Queen before the Great Calamity. Like Purah and Robbie, by the time of the game, she is around 120 years old. The Sheikah are notably longer-lived than Hylians, so even at this age she was able to serve as the village’s chief: but at some point after the fall of Calamity Ganon, she decided to pass the torch to her granddaughter, Paya. One day, Impa suddenly announced that Paya would take over her duties - and instead began researching old books in the village. Paya was blindsided by the announcement: she didn’t yet feel ready for such a responsibility, and felt that her grandmother’s chief’s hat was too heavy for her head. When the Upheaval happened, and the ring ruins rained down on Kakariko, Impa suddenly announced that she planned to leave. Together with Cado, she packed her bags: Paya pleaded for her to stay, but Impa insisted that an event like the Upheaval was precisely the reason she must go. The new chief conceded, and bid her grandmother farewell: but not before noticing something in her eyes that said that she was embarking on some great mission. Paya later looked through the books Impa had been reading, and discovered eleven strange symbols inside: symbols which she believes are related to Impa’s quest. The books Impa had been reading concerned the Geoglyphs: eleven symbols which had mysteriously appeared on Hyrule’s surface since the Upheaval. If viewed from high above, these giant symbols become clear: from the Master Sword to a Secret Stone or the Purah Pad. For this reason, Impa and Cado travel across the land in a hot air balloon given to them by Purah: providing them with the altitude necessary to properly study these markings. Each geoglyph makes use of many teardrop shapes - and these hold a secret. One teardrop contains a Dragon’s Tear - a small, circular pool. These Dragon’s Tears are the spots where the Light Dragon’s actual tears fell, right after Zelda transformed: she shed memories of her time in the distant past that became embedded in the land at these sacred sites. When Link interacts with the pool, he experiences a vision: a memory from Zelda’s time in the distant past. These Dragon’s Tears, then, have existed for millennia. Ancient people found these sites, and they, too, experienced visions of Zelda’s past. Impa claims that a passage found in old literature from Kakariko Village describes this: and notes that a group of people in the distant past, possibly Sheikah themselves, marked these sites with images depicting what they saw in the visions. Interestingly, these ancient people must have also had some ability to control time: Link is only able to see the visions as the Tears react with his Recall ability. At some point, a chamber was built in the back of the Forgotten Temple to catalogue these glyphs - a great map of the Kingdom, with each symbol marked on the wall surrounding it. We can tell that this chamber was built sometime after the construction of Hyrule Castle over the seal, as the castle is represented on the map. The room just before this was the very place where Rauru had planned Hyrule’s defence, and granted the Sages with the secret stones - and even now, thousands of years later, Link can find a stone marking Sonia’s grave, where Rauru once grieved. Interestingly, Sonia’s gravestone is surrounded by Sundelion flowers - which grow on Sky Islands and can cure the effects of Gloom - perhaps the Sundelion somehow represented Sonia, just like how the Silent Princess represents her distant descendant, Zelda - whose story is immortalised in the next room. For whatever reason, these geoglyphs weren’t visible until after the Upheaval: the recent events triggered something and caused them to appear. Ganondorf’s return causing the appearance of the glyphs seems to have been part of the plan of whoever created them: Paya notes that Impa left Kakariko immediately after the Upheaval - cryptically noting that times like these are exactly why she must leave. Just like Breath of the Wild, Link again ventures across the Kingdom, piecing together a story from a distant age, piece by piece. Collecting the tears of a deity is a staple in the Zelda series: Link has previously collected sacred tears in Skyward Sword’s Silent Realms and the Light Tears in Twilight Princess. A teardrop specifically containing information was seen in Breath of the Wild with the Ancient Sheikah technology: if it was Impa’s Sheikah ancestors who found the tears of the Light Dragon and created geoglyphs around them, perhaps this in turn inspired something about the tribe’s symbols, just like how the Ancient Sages and their Temples went on to inspire the designs of the Sheikah Divine Beasts. Only after he’s recovered all of the Dragon’s Tears’ memories does Link uncover the truth about Princess Zelda. Upon seeing the final vision, the Light Dragon appears above Link: and from it falls a single tear, landing in the centre of the Rist Peninsula. This final Dragon’s Tear is formed from Zelda’s memory of becoming the Light Dragon, revealing to Link her terrible fate. As Link wakes from the final memory, the Light Dragon roars and circles above his head - and the Hero finds the area where the Tear fell full of Silent Princess flowers: Zelda’s flowers. Not only does he now know the sinister identity of the Princess since the Upheaval, he now knows the truth about the real Princess’s sacrifice. He has found his Zelda, but she is lost - trapped forever in a body not her own. But Link’s quest must continue - he must find the fifth Sage, and bring the fight to the Demon King. After Impa had left Kakariko to search for the geoglyphs, Paya had informed Purah of the Ring Ruins that had landed on her village, who claimed that Zonai ruins shaped like this are incredibly unusual. Paya then contacted the Zonai Survey Team, who in turn travelled to the village to investigate. It was soon discovered that each Ring contained stone slabs marked with Zonai text - fascinating discoveries that were translated by Tauro, head of the ZST. He learned that each described details about the Ancient Sages, the secret stones, and the Imprisoning War. A fifth ring ruin was found directly above Kakariko Village’s north gate, ominously suspended in the air. But Ganondorf had sent his phantom saboteur to the Sheikah’s hometown, too - according to Paya, Princess Zelda herself had travelled to Kakariko to inspect the ruins that had fallen there. She had ordered that the floating ruin was off limits, without expressing any concern for the wellbeing of the villagers. The Ring Ruins breathe new life into the Sheikah’s hometown. Researchers and tourists alike pour into the village, having travelled from all corners of Hyrule to see, or even study, the mysterious relics from a forgotten civilisation that have rained down on Kakariko. Dorian’s youngest daughter, Koko, sets up a little shop selling Ring Garlands to celebrate this occasion. Dr. Calip, a researcher who originally lived in a hut near Fort Hateno before joining the ZST, is responsible for restricting access to the floating Ring Ruin: which he does with irritating efficiency. Only after destroying the phantom in the castle and explaining the truth about puppet Zelda to Paya does Calip let up, allowing Link to Ascend into the floating ruin and photograph the stone slab inside for Tauro to translate. The head of the Survey Team isn’t able to fully translate the slab, but what he can make out tells of Mineru, and mentions a key, hidden in the south east - finally, a clue to the location of the missing Sage. Paya, who had been learning how to decipher Zonai script since the Upheaval, is able to contribute to Tauro’s translation: adding that the slab appears to mention “the dragon land”. She suggests that they search in the Faron region, a place connected with the Ancient Zonai found in the southeast: known as the Zonai Ruins. Before the Upheaval and the emergence of the Sky Islands, this was the largest, and perhaps most mysterious, Zonai site left on Hyrule’s Surface. Great walls and statues are built along the winding Dracozu River, the serpentine shape of which inspired the ancient song called “The Serpent’s Jaws”. The Zonai Ruins were where the mystery of this lost tribe began in Breath of the Wild, and, fittingly, it’s where the mystery ends in Tears of the Kingdom. The Zonai Survey Team moves to the Faron region, and Paya’s translation is proven correct: together with Calip and Tauro, Link uncovers a sequence of ancient chambers containing the Charged robes: a set once used in ancient rituals, presumably designed to worship Farosh, the Lightning Dragon who is often spotted in the skies directly above this region. The Zonai Ruins in Faron are another location that appears to have changed since the Upheaval: new, taller dragon statues appear, built from the same smooth white stone as the Sky Islands, rather than the weathered stone of the rest of the surface ruins. Like the appearance of the islands themselves, and the emergence of the Geoglyphs around the Dragon's Tears, it seems that Ganondorf’s resurrection triggered a response from Ancient Zonai sites: opening pathways for the Hero that Zelda had promised. The Zonai Ruins’ new statues reveal their secret when struck by lightning: they disperse the eternal thunderstorm that cloaks the islands above this region, allowing Link to make his way to Dragonhead Island, and find Mineru’s mask. This owl-shaped device was developed by Mineru in the distant past - seen here when she talks to Zelda. Somehow, it reacts to the presence of Mineru’s spirit inside the Purah Pad, and the Sage of Spirit is able to speak: she guides Link first to the Surface, and then into the endless Depths below. Of course, Mineru had decided to join Zelda in her plan to reach the future: instead of consuming her secret stone and draconifying, she instead transferred her spirit to the Purah Pad, which was guarded by a Steward Construct on the Great Sky Island until it was given to Link. Mineru had intended to awaken alongside Zelda’s Knight, but, like with the four regional phenomena, Ganondorf had focused some of his power on stopping the re-emergence of the Sage of Spirit, too. Link brings the mask to the Construct Factory, where Mineru once created machines to serve as vessels for her spirit. In the distant past, she had built a colossal Construct here, and showed it to Zelda: it was so big and so powerful that the Princess was able to ride on its shoulders like riding a horse. Mineru’s original plan was to guide Link to this Construct as soon as he received the Purah Pad, but there was a problem: when Ganondorf returned, he managed to seize control of Mineru’s Construct where it lay dormant, deep underground: just like he had seized control of the Guardians and Divine Beasts during the Great Calamity. Link is instead required to gather parts from the various storehouses to built Mineru a new body: a new giant mecha, like the one she had built and showed to Zelda in the distant past, and the ultimate weapon created by the Yiga Clan. With the Construct operational, Mineru guides him to the Spirit Temple just south-east, where she had hidden away her secret stone. The platform directly before the secret stone’s chamber is soaked in Gloom - and, without warning, an electrified fence rises to trap Link and Mineru’s construct inside. A platform opens in the floor, and from it leaps Mineru’s forgotten project: the original Construct, now possessed by a different spirit: Ganondorf’s Gloom fuels it from within, twisting it into a savage killing machine. The most dangerous game of rock-em, sock-em robots begins - with Link and Mineru controlling the new Construct, and Ganondorf the Siezed Construct. Both machines bring the pinnacle of Zonai engineering to bear against one another - spiked balls and electric blades smash through ancient armour, and cannon fire shakes the subterranean Temple. Eventually, though, Link and Mineru are victorious: the Seized Construct is destroyed, opening the way to the final secret stone. Mineru’s spirit jumps out of the Purah Pad, and floats towards the Spirit Stone - which in turn jumps into the Construct body Link had just created. The fifth Sage was awakened - Mineru had returned to the battle, after thousands of years. Mineru tells Link about the story of the Imprisoning War, of Zelda the Sage of Time and of her sacrifice to empower the Master Sword. She explains that Zelda had given her a message: to tell Link to speak to the Great Deku Tree, and recover the blade of evil’s bane. It’s unclear whether or not the Great Deku Tree existed in the time of King Rauru. It doesn’t appear to be present in the same location here, or at least, if it is, it didn’t yet have such a giant spread of cherry blossom leaves. But we know that this Deku Tree is ancient, and has watched over Hyrule for countless years. Regardless of whether or not it existed yet in the distant past, Zelda was somehow able to relay a message to the Tree: perhaps she spoke to it long after her draconification, communicating with the forest deity as the Light Dragon to inform it of her plan. But the Korok Forest, and its guardian, also suffered with the return of Ganondorf. A shadowy fog clouded the Lost Woods, and the Deku Tree itself suffered a curse: a splinter of Ganondorf’s raw power tortured him from within, and the forest’s Koroks were paralysed due to their father’s condition. This is very similar to the Deku Tree’s fate in Ocarina of Time: where Ganondorf cursed it with the parasitic Queen Gohma, which also rotted the deity from the inside. But this time, Ganondorf took an even more direct approach: the Deku’s Tree’s curse was Phantom Ganon: created from the Demon King’s flesh and blood, just like the saboteur that had disguised itself as Zelda. Destroying this Phantom restores the Deku Tree’s vitality, and returns the Korok Forest to a peaceful sanctuary. Now recovered, the Deku Tree can speak to Link for the first time since before the Upheaval: the time when Link and Zelda had travelled to the Forest to retrieve the Master Sword. The Deku Tree notes that Link no longer has it, but claims that he can sense the blade: In the head of the Light Dragon, where it has been for thousands of years. After healing the Deku Tree and learning of the Master Sword’s fate, Link finds that the Light Dragon has lowered its altitude. Almost as if it knows that Link is searching for it, it begins to fly much closer to the surface - allowing the Hero to jump from the heavens and land on its back, clinging to the Master Sword for dear life. The Light Dragon screams and writhes its body, trying to shake Link, like the very act of touching the blade causes it pain. It swings its head violently from side to side, but, by this point, Link has recovered enough of his lost vitality to hold on - desperately, until… the Dragon subsides, and glides, silently, higher and higher. After a flash of light, Link finds himself in a realm of golden skies - only white clouds and sunbeams break up the heavenly space. The Light Dragon’s hair uncoils from the blade - allowing Link to gently remove it. The blade that was broken shall return to Hyrule. A vision appears to Link of the Princess, floating in a sea of white light, pouring her power into the blade. Interestingly, the back of her right hand glows with a bright golden light - and it’s this light that flows into the sword, repairing it. When Zelda used her sealing powers in Breath of the Wild, it was represented by the mark of the Triforce appearing on her hand: it seems like the same thing happens here, as she directs this sacred Light directly into the sword that seals the darkness. The Master Sword itself has been transformed by its time with the Light Dragon. Though Zelda’s power has restored the blade, the scars of Ganondorf’s attack are still visible. It seems that the sword has also been imbued with Ancient Zonai powers, too: it reacts when its wielder uses the Zonai Fuse ability - mysterious green symbols appear along the blade, and Fused materials take on a ghostly green shade. Though she had succeeded in delivering the blade to Link… Zelda’s sacrifice was permanent. She had become an eternal dragon, doomed to wander the skies forever. The Light Dragon drops Link off at the Temple of Time, then flies off, without a word, to continue her endless solitude. But Zelda had done it. Her last thoughts before she lost herself were of Link: she knew that he would arrive in the future, and protect them all. And now, with the Sages awakened again, a battle tens of thousands of years in the making could begin. Link and Purah convene for a final time at Lookout Landing. The Hero informs her of the awakening of the Sage of Spirit, and of the discovery of the Master Sword in the Light Dragon’s head. This means that Zelda’s plan from the distant past was almost complete: all that remained was finding Ganondorf himself. Purah suggests that Link not look on the Surface or the Skies above, but instead search below their feet, in the hellish Depths beneath the ground. The Depths are quite literally the underworld, a dark world that mirrors Hyrule above it. The Depths are home to Poes, lost spirits of the dead, who can be guided to the afterlife by Bargainer Statues: which are themselves dark reflections of the Goddess Statues found directly above them. The spirits of soldiers float above grave markers, offering up weapons. These are presumably soldiers who lost their lives to the Great Calamity a hundred years ago - like these three, gathered directly underneath Castle Town, at the heart of the Guardian assault. Monsters in the Depths never sleep, with the obvious exception of the Hinox. They gather in groups and mine for Zonaite - which they harvest for some unknown purpose. Pools of Gloom stain the surface, crawling with giant dark roots, pulsing with Ganondorf’s energy. Like veins, these dark roots are spread across the entire Depths, but are focused on Ganondorf’s lair, deep below the Castle. This has been apparent since the very beginning of the game, of course: Link and Zelda both saw Ganondorf allow himself to fall into the black pit below where he had been Imprisoned. So, following his own footsteps, Link begins his final descent - into the bowels of the castle, to his Kingdom’s forgotten foundations. Directly below the floating castle is the Hyrule Castle chasm - the pit that opened up when the citadel was thrust upwards when the seal broke. We can see here that the castle isn’t actually levitating, but instead sits on a thin, tall pillar of ancient stone, marked with Zonai symbols. This stone column was directly connected to the platform Ganondorf had pushed upwards with his Gloom after he awoke - forcibly moving the entire structure upwards. At the bottom of this great chasm are tunnels from the distant past, leading to old stone passageways and staircases built by the Hyruleans in a forgotten age. Eventually, Link reaches the very same tunnels he had explored with Zelda at the beginning of the game, before the Princess had travelled to the past. We don’t know exactly how Link and Zelda accessed these tunnels originally - only that a hidden staircase had been discovered during the investigation into the Gloom. Now, after the Upheaval, the Forgotten Foundation can only be accessed through the Depths now that the Castle has moved - so perhaps whatever route originally led here has been displaced or blocked off by the disturbance. The first time Link walked here, these tunnels had been eerily empty, save for a small group of Keese, and were filled with a thin, wispy form of Gloom. But now that the Demon King has awoken, his Gloom has completely choked this place: it has gathered in pools on the floor, and surrounds powerful monsters. With the Blade of Evil’s Bane on his back, Link continues: deeper and deeper into where it all started. Ganondorf’s aura grows stronger the further down Link delves, until: the Gloom is strong enough to break the spiritual connection Link and Rauru’s hand has with the Sages: their avatars cannot reach this deep. Link goes alone. Eventually, he reaches the mural chamber: where he and Zelda had discovered ancient depictions of Hyrule’s earliest history - of the birth of the Kingdom, and the outbreak\n",

      "Consolidated Context from ChromaDB: Ever since Link and Zelda had ventured below the Castle to investigate the Gloom, Hyrule had been a land without a ruler - desperately searching for any sign of its missing Princess. And, since the Upheaval, there was hope: reports of sightings of Zelda came in from all across the country - of the Princess visiting stables and villages, even Hyrule Castle itself. But when Link, and the Sages he had awakened from each of the four regions, had stormed the floating citadel, they had uncovered the truth: this was not Hyrule’s Princess, but Ganondorf himself: a phantom conjured by his power, designed to sabotage and manipulate Hyrule from the inside. Ganondorf’s puppet had been responsible for all of the regional phenomena, and had appeared at Hyrule Castle specifically to lure Link into a trap. And, this would have worked: Link would have once again fallen victim to the terrible Gloom, were it not for the intervention of the Sages. The mystery of the actual Princess Zelda’s disappearance had only grown deeper, but the truth of the Upheaval itself was now clear to everyone: it had been caused by the return of Ganondorf, the Demon King from the legend of the Imprisoning War. News of the Demon King’s return spread like wildfire - printed on the front page of newspapers, and muttered under the breath of stable owners. Link and the Sages convene with Purah at Lookout Landing to form a plan. They are all now aware of the identity of Puppet Zelda, and that the real Zelda must have travelled somehow to the distant past - as when each of them had awakened as a Sage, they had seen visions of the confrontation with Ganondorf, and of their predecessors talking to Princess Zelda. They know that Zelda had come up with a plan to defeat the Demon King - that they were destined to fight alongside Link now he has returned in the present day. But other than that, they don’t know anything about Ganondorf, his story or his goals, other than that he is “bad news and super strong.” Purah notices that, when the Sages told her of the visions they had seen of the distant past, there had been six sages supporting King Rauru in the battle: Wind, Fire, Water, Lightning, Time, but also Spirit: Mineru. Purah notes that each of the Sages present had awoken at ancient ruins from the time of King Rauru, and guesses that Mineru might be found in a similar place. The group splits up to search for clues: Tulin, Yunobo, Sidon and Riju return to their regions to hunt there, but Link instead heads towards the home of the Sheikah: Kakariko Village. Ever since the Upheaval, Zelda’s Zonai Survey Team had been investigating strange, ring-shaped ruins that had fallen directly on top of Kakariko Village. During Breath of the Wild, the chief of Kakariko Village had been Impa - a royal advisor to the King and Queen before the Great Calamity. Like Purah and Robbie, by the time of the game, she is around 120 years old. The Sheikah are notably longer-lived than Hylians, so even at this age she was able to serve as the village’s chief: but at some point after the fall of Calamity Ganon, she decided to pass the torch to her granddaughter, Paya. One day, Impa suddenly announced that Paya would take over her duties - and instead began researching old books in the village. Paya was blindsided by the announcement: she didn’t yet feel ready for such a responsibility, and felt that her grandmother’s chief’s hat was too heavy for her head. When the Upheaval happened, and the ring ruins rained down on Kakariko, Impa suddenly announced that she planned to leave. Together with Cado, she packed her bags: Paya pleaded for her to stay, but Impa insisted that an event like the Upheaval was precisely the reason she must go. The new chief conceded, and bid her grandmother farewell: but not before noticing something in her eyes that said that she was embarking on some great mission. Paya later looked through the books Impa had been reading, and discovered eleven strange symbols inside: symbols which she believes are related to Impa’s quest. The books Impa had been reading concerned the Geoglyphs: eleven symbols which had mysteriously appeared on Hyrule’s surface since the Upheaval. If viewed from high above, these giant symbols become clear: from the Master Sword to a Secret Stone or the Purah Pad. For this reason, Impa and Cado travel across the land in a hot air balloon given to them by Purah: providing them with the altitude necessary to properly study these markings. Each geoglyph makes use of many teardrop shapes - and these hold a secret. One teardrop contains a Dragon’s Tear - a small, circular pool. These Dragon’s Tears are the spots where the Light Dragon’s actual tears fell, right after Zelda transformed: she shed memories of her time in the distant past that became embedded in the land at these sacred sites. When Link interacts with the pool, he experiences a vision: a memory from Zelda’s time in the distant past. These Dragon’s Tears, then, have existed for millennia. Ancient people found these sites, and they, too, experienced visions of Zelda’s past. Impa claims that a passage found in old literature from Kakariko Village describes this: and notes that a group of people in the distant past, possibly Sheikah themselves, marked these sites with images depicting what they saw in the visions. Interestingly, these ancient people must have also had some ability to control time: Link is only able to see the visions as the Tears react with his Recall ability. At some point, a chamber was built in the back of the Forgotten Temple to catalogue these glyphs - a great map of the Kingdom, with each symbol marked on the wall surrounding it. We can tell that this chamber was built sometime after the construction of Hyrule Castle over the seal, as the castle is represented on the map. The room just before this was the very place where Rauru had planned Hyrule’s defence, and granted the Sages with the secret stones - and even now, thousands of years later, Link can find a stone marking Sonia’s grave, where Rauru once grieved. Interestingly, Sonia’s gravestone is surrounded by Sundelion flowers - which grow on Sky Islands and can cure the effects of Gloom - perhaps the Sundelion somehow represented Sonia, just like how the Silent Princess represents her distant descendant, Zelda - whose story is immortalised in the next room. For whatever reason, these geoglyphs weren’t visible until after the Upheaval: the recent events triggered something and caused them to appear. Ganondorf’s return causing the appearance of the glyphs seems to have been part of the plan of whoever created them: Paya notes that Impa left Kakariko immediately after the Upheaval - cryptically noting that times like these are exactly why she must leave. Just like Breath of the Wild, Link again ventures across the Kingdom, piecing together a story from a distant age, piece by piece. Collecting the tears of a deity is a staple in the Zelda series: Link has previously collected sacred tears in Skyward Sword’s Silent Realms and the Light Tears in Twilight Princess. A teardrop specifically containing information was seen in Breath of the Wild with the Ancient Sheikah technology: if it was Impa’s Sheikah ancestors who found the tears of the Light Dragon and created geoglyphs around them, perhaps this in turn inspired something about the tribe’s symbols, just like how the Ancient Sages and their Temples went on to inspire the designs of the Sheikah Divine Beasts. Only after he’s recovered all of the Dragon’s Tears’ memories does Link uncover the truth about Princess Zelda. Upon seeing the final vision, the Light Dragon appears above Link: and from it falls a single tear, landing in the centre of the Rist Peninsula. This final Dragon’s Tear is formed from Zelda’s memory of becoming the Light Dragon, revealing to Link her terrible fate. As Link wakes from the final memory, the Light Dragon roars and circles above his head - and the Hero finds the area where the Tear fell full of Silent Princess flowers: Zelda’s flowers. Not only does he now know the sinister identity of the Princess since the Upheaval, he now knows the truth about the real Princess’s sacrifice. He has found his Zelda, but she is lost - trapped forever in a body not her own. But Link’s quest must continue - he must find the fifth Sage, and bring the fight to the Demon King. After Impa had left Kakariko to search for the geoglyphs, Paya had informed Purah of the Ring Ruins that had landed on her village, who claimed that Zonai ruins shaped like this are incredibly unusual. Paya then contacted the Zonai Survey Team, who in turn travelled to the village to investigate. It was soon discovered that each Ring contained stone slabs marked with Zonai text - fascinating discoveries that were translated by Tauro, head of the ZST. He learned that each described details about the Ancient Sages, the secret stones, and the Imprisoning War. A fifth ring ruin was found directly above Kakariko Village’s north gate, ominously suspended in the air. But Ganondorf had sent his phantom saboteur to the Sheikah’s hometown, too - according to Paya, Princess Zelda herself had travelled to Kakariko to inspect the ruins that had fallen there. She had ordered that the floating ruin was off limits, without expressing any concern for the wellbeing of the villagers. The Ring Ruins breathe new life into the Sheikah’s hometown. Researchers and tourists alike pour into the village, having travelled from all corners of Hyrule to see, or even study, the mysterious relics from a forgotten civilisation that have rained down on Kakariko. Dorian’s youngest daughter, Koko, sets up a little shop selling Ring Garlands to celebrate this occasion. Dr. Calip, a researcher who originally lived in a hut near Fort Hateno before joining the ZST, is responsible for restricting access to the floating Ring Ruin: which he does with irritating efficiency. Only after destroying the phantom in the castle and explaining the truth about puppet Zelda to Paya does Calip let up, allowing Link to Ascend into the floating ruin and photograph the stone slab inside for Tauro to translate. The head of the Survey Team isn’t able to fully translate the slab, but what he can make out tells of Mineru, and mentions a key, hidden in the south east - finally, a clue to the location of the missing Sage. Paya, who had been learning how to decipher Zonai script since the Upheaval, is able to contribute to Tauro’s translation: adding that the slab appears to mention “the dragon land”. She suggests that they search in the Faron region, a place connected with the Ancient Zonai found in the southeast: known as the Zonai Ruins. Before the Upheaval and the emergence of the Sky Islands, this was the largest, and perhaps most mysterious, Zonai site left on Hyrule’s Surface. Great walls and statues are built along the winding Dracozu River, the serpentine shape of which inspired the ancient song called “The Serpent’s Jaws”. The Zonai Ruins were where the mystery of this lost tribe began in Breath of the Wild, and, fittingly, it’s where the mystery ends in Tears of the Kingdom. The Zonai Survey Team moves to the Faron region, and Paya’s translation is proven correct: together with Calip and Tauro, Link uncovers a sequence of ancient chambers containing the Charged robes: a set once used in ancient rituals, presumably designed to worship Farosh, the Lightning Dragon who is often spotted in the skies directly above this region. The Zonai Ruins in Faron are another location that appears to have changed since the Upheaval: new, taller dragon statues appear, built from the same smooth white stone as the Sky Islands, rather than the weathered stone of the rest of the surface ruins. Like the appearance of the islands themselves, and the emergence of the Geoglyphs around the Dragon's Tears, it seems that Ganondorf’s resurrection triggered a response from Ancient Zonai sites: opening pathways for the Hero that Zelda had promised. The Zonai Ruins’ new statues reveal their secret when struck by lightning: they disperse the eternal thunderstorm that cloaks the islands above this region, allowing Link to make his way to Dragonhead Island, and find Mineru’s mask. This owl-shaped device was developed by Mineru in the distant past - seen here when she talks to Zelda. Somehow, it reacts to the presence of Mineru’s spirit inside the Purah Pad, and the Sage of Spirit is able to speak: she guides Link first to the Surface, and then into the endless Depths below. Of course, Mineru had decided to join Zelda in her plan to reach the future: instead of consuming her secret stone and draconifying, she instead transferred her spirit to the Purah Pad, which was guarded by a Steward Construct on the Great Sky Island until it was given to Link. Mineru had intended to awaken alongside Zelda’s Knight, but, like with the four regional phenomena, Ganondorf had focused some of his power on stopping the re-emergence of the Sage of Spirit, too. Link brings the mask to the Construct Factory, where Mineru once created machines to serve as vessels for her spirit. In the distant past, she had built a colossal Construct here, and showed it to Zelda: it was so big and so powerful that the Princess was able to ride on its shoulders like riding a horse. Mineru’s original plan was to guide Link to this Construct as soon as he received the Purah Pad, but there was a problem: when Ganondorf returned, he managed to seize control of Mineru’s Construct where it lay dormant, deep underground: just like he had seized control of the Guardians and Divine Beasts during the Great Calamity. Link is instead required to gather parts from the various storehouses to built Mineru a new body: a new giant mecha, like the one she had built and showed to Zelda in the distant past, and the ultimate weapon created by the Yiga Clan. With the Construct operational, Mineru guides him to the Spirit Temple just south-east, where she had hidden away her secret stone. The platform directly before the secret stone’s chamber is soaked in Gloom - and, without warning, an electrified fence rises to trap Link and Mineru’s construct inside. A platform opens in the floor, and from it leaps Mineru’s forgotten project: the original Construct, now possessed by a different spirit: Ganondorf’s Gloom fuels it from within, twisting it into a savage killing machine. The most dangerous game of rock-em, sock-em robots begins - with Link and Mineru controlling the new Construct, and Ganondorf the Siezed Construct. Both machines bring the pinnacle of Zonai engineering to bear against one another - spiked balls and electric blades smash through ancient armour, and cannon fire shakes the subterranean Temple. Eventually, though, Link and Mineru are victorious: the Seized Construct is destroyed, opening the way to the final secret stone. Mineru’s spirit jumps out of the Purah Pad, and floats towards the Spirit Stone - which in turn jumps into the Construct body Link had just created. The fifth Sage was awakened - Mineru had returned to the battle, after thousands of years. Mineru tells Link about the story of the Imprisoning War, of Zelda the Sage of Time and of her sacrifice to empower the Master Sword. She explains that Zelda had given her a message: to tell Link to speak to the Great Deku Tree, and recover the blade of evil’s bane. It’s unclear whether or not the Great Deku Tree existed in the time of King Rauru. It doesn’t appear to be present in the same location here, or at least, if it is, it didn’t yet have such a giant spread of cherry blossom leaves. But we know that this Deku Tree is ancient, and has watched over Hyrule for countless years. Regardless of whether or not it existed yet in the distant past, Zelda was somehow able to relay a message to the Tree: perhaps she spoke to it long after her draconification, communicating with the forest deity as the Light Dragon to inform it of her plan. But the Korok Forest, and its guardian, also suffered with the return of Ganondorf. A shadowy fog clouded the Lost Woods, and the Deku Tree itself suffered a curse: a splinter of Ganondorf’s raw power tortured him from within, and the forest’s Koroks were paralysed due to their father’s condition. This is very similar to the Deku Tree’s fate in Ocarina of Time: where Ganondorf cursed it with the parasitic Queen Gohma, which also rotted the deity from the inside. But this time, Ganondorf took an even more direct approach: the Deku’s Tree’s curse was Phantom Ganon: created from the Demon King’s flesh and blood, just like the saboteur that had disguised itself as Zelda. Destroying this Phantom restores the Deku Tree’s vitality, and returns the Korok Forest to a peaceful sanctuary. Now recovered, the Deku Tree can speak to Link for the first time since before the Upheaval: the time when Link and Zelda had travelled to the Forest to retrieve the Master Sword. The Deku Tree notes that Link no longer has it, but claims that he can sense the blade: In the head of the Light Dragon, where it has been for thousands of years. After healing the Deku Tree and learning of the Master Sword’s fate, Link finds that the Light Dragon has lowered its altitude. Almost as if it knows that Link is searching for it, it begins to fly much closer to the surface - allowing the Hero to jump from the heavens and land on its back, clinging to the Master Sword for dear life. The Light Dragon screams and writhes its body, trying to shake Link, like the very act of touching the blade causes it pain. It swings its head violently from side to side, but, by this point, Link has recovered enough of his lost vitality to hold on - desperately, until… the Dragon subsides, and glides, silently, higher and higher. After a flash of light, Link finds himself in a realm of golden skies - only white clouds and sunbeams break up the heavenly space. The Light Dragon’s hair uncoils from the blade - allowing Link to gently remove it. The blade that was broken shall return to Hyrule. A vision appears to Link of the Princess, floating in a sea of white light, pouring her power into the blade. Interestingly, the back of her right hand glows with a bright golden light - and it’s this light that flows into the sword, repairing it. When Zelda used her sealing powers in Breath of the Wild, it was represented by the mark of the Triforce appearing on her hand: it seems like the same thing happens here, as she directs this sacred Light directly into the sword that seals the darkness. The Master Sword itself has been transformed by its time with the Light Dragon. Though Zelda’s power has restored the blade, the scars of Ganondorf’s attack are still visible. It seems that the sword has also been imbued with Ancient Zonai powers, too: it reacts when its wielder uses the Zonai Fuse ability - mysterious green symbols appear along the blade, and Fused materials take on a ghostly green shade. Though she had succeeded in delivering the blade to Link… Zelda’s sacrifice was permanent. She had become an eternal dragon, doomed to wander the skies forever. The Light Dragon drops Link off at the Temple of Time, then flies off, without a word, to continue her endless solitude. But Zelda had done it. Her last thoughts before she lost herself were of Link: she knew that he would arrive in the future, and protect them all. And now, with the Sages awakened again, a battle tens of thousands of years in the making could begin. Link and Purah convene for a final time at Lookout Landing. The Hero informs her of the awakening of the Sage of Spirit, and of the discovery of the Master Sword in the Light Dragon’s head. This means that Zelda’s plan from the distant past was almost complete: all that remained was finding Ganondorf himself. Purah suggests that Link not look on the Surface or the Skies above, but instead search below their feet, in the hellish Depths beneath the ground. The Depths are quite literally the underworld, a dark world that mirrors Hyrule above it. The Depths are home to Poes, lost spirits of the dead, who can be guided to the afterlife by Bargainer Statues: which are themselves dark reflections of the Goddess Statues found directly above them. The spirits of soldiers float above grave markers, offering up weapons. These are presumably soldiers who lost their lives to the Great Calamity a hundred years ago - like these three, gathered directly underneath Castle Town, at the heart of the Guardian assault. Monsters in the Depths never sleep, with the obvious exception of the Hinox. They gather in groups and mine for Zonaite - which they harvest for some unknown purpose. Pools of Gloom stain the surface, crawling with giant dark roots, pulsing with Ganondorf’s energy. Like veins, these dark roots are spread across the entire Depths, but are focused on Ganondorf’s lair, deep below the Castle. This has been apparent since the very beginning of the game, of course: Link and Zelda both saw Ganondorf allow himself to fall into the black pit below where he had been Imprisoned. So, following his own footsteps, Link begins his final descent - into the bowels of the castle, to his Kingdom’s forgotten foundations. Directly below the floating castle is the Hyrule Castle chasm - the pit that opened up when the citadel was thrust upwards when the seal broke. We can see here that the castle isn’t actually levitating, but instead sits on a thin, tall pillar of ancient stone, marked with Zonai symbols. This stone column was directly connected to the platform Ganondorf had pushed upwards with his Gloom after he awoke - forcibly moving the entire structure upwards. At the bottom of this great chasm are tunnels from the distant past, leading to old stone passageways and staircases built by the Hyruleans in a forgotten age. Eventually, Link reaches the very same tunnels he had explored with Zelda at the beginning of the game, before the Princess had travelled to the past. We don’t know exactly how Link and Zelda accessed these tunnels originally - only that a hidden staircase had been discovered during the investigation into the Gloom. Now, after the Upheaval, the Forgotten Foundation can only be accessed through the Depths now that the Castle has moved - so perhaps whatever route originally led here has been displaced or blocked off by the disturbance. The first time Link walked here, these tunnels had been eerily empty, save for a small group of Keese, and were filled with a thin, wispy form of Gloom. But now that the Demon King has awoken, his Gloom has completely choked this place: it has gathered in pools on the floor, and surrounds powerful monsters. With the Blade of Evil’s Bane on his back, Link continues: deeper and deeper into where it all started. Ganondorf’s aura grows stronger the further down Link delves, until: the Gloom is strong enough to break the spiritual connection Link and Rauru’s hand has with the Sages: their avatars cannot reach this deep. Link goes alone. Eventually, he reaches the mural chamber: where he and Zelda had discovered ancient depictions of Hyrule’s earliest history - of the birth of the Kingdom, and the outbreak\n",

      "Consolidated Context from ChromaDB: Breath of the Wild was a game about loneliness, an amnesiac Hero uncovering the truth of his Kingdom’s collapse, learning to survive and overcome the hostile wilderness left after the Great Calamity. Its direct sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, is instead a game about connections, about bringing Hyrule’s next generation together to fight against an ancient, yet familiar evil. Both games are set in the Kingdom of Hyrule - a vast land steeped in history and legend. The story of this Kingdom stretches back thousands upon thousands of years, though many details from its histories have been eroded or distorted by the passage of time, or even lost entirely. Breath of the Wild explains that Hyrule’s history is inextricably linked with the story of the Calamity Ganon - a primal evil that has appeared time and time again. An ancient legend tells of a war 10,000 years ago, where an emergence of the Calamity had been repelled by a Hero, a Princess, and the power of the Sheikah tribe. This nightmare returned a century before Breath of the Wild - a terrible, apocalyptic event that resulted in the death of the King, and the destruction of most of the Kingdom. The Calamity was eventually defeated by Link, a Hylian Knight, after recovering for a hundred years in the Shrine of Resurrection. Very little is known about the Calamity. Ancient texts suggest that it was once a Gerudo man, but now is more akin to a force of nature: it does not communicate - it can’t be bargained with, and it wants nothing but the destruction of the Kingdom. Every time it appears, it appears from the same place - directly underneath Hyrule Castle itself. After destroying the Calamity together, Zelda spent the next few years rebuilding Hyrule, accompanied always by her Chosen Knight, Link. She moves into the house Link bought in Hateno Village where she oversees the construction of a school to educate Hyrule’s next generation. To do this, she employs Bolson, the old head Carpenter, who has since passed the torch to Hudson, our beloved President of what is now called Hudson Construction. With Hudson’s help, Hyrule began the monumental task of restoring what they had lost to the Calamity. The President not only worked to expand Tarrey Town in Akkala, he also built a new fortification over the Sacred Grounds just south of the Castle: Lookout Landing, which quickly became a thriving community at the centre of the country. His company set up resource caches all across the land: he was at the centre of a civilisation just beginning to piece itself back together. Ganon itself is once again fading into myth. Children are born and grow up believing the Calamity to be little more than a fairy tale. And, to be fair to the children, almost every single relic of the Ancient Sheikah was hidden or destroyed after the Calamity’s defeat - the Divine Beasts, Guardian shells and Shrines all removed from the land. It’s possible that some of the old technology was processed for parts - used in the construction of Skyview Towers. These were designed by the Sheikah scientist Purah and built by none other than Hudson Construction, intended to survey their surroundings and provide accurate map data. Purah, and the other Sheikah scientist, Robbie, had been in the Royal Family’s service since before the Great Calamity - responsible for all manner of research into ancient technology. And after Calamity Ganon was defeated, they put their minds to Zelda’s restoration project: eventually constructing the Purah Pad. This device is entirely different to the Sheikah Slate used by Link in Breath of the Wild, which was over 10,000 years old by that point: this one is much newer - a tool designed to help Zelda with her work. A prototype had been built by Robbie, then the device was refined and improved by both scientists, including the addition of the Camera Rune. Purah wonders if there will be a time when everyone in Hyrule carries their very own Purah Pad. We knew from Purah’s Diary in Breath of the Wild that she already possessed her own Sheikah Slate even back then, and used it to install and experiment with an Anti-Aging Rune. Like Robbie, Purah is well over a century old - but prior to the events of Breath of the Wild, performed an experiment that resulted in her reverting to the appearance of a small child. At some point after that game, she became fed up of being treated as a child, and of needing jet packs to reach high places, so adjusted her device, accelerating her development until she resembled a twenty year old woman. Zelda wasn’t only interested in technology, but archaeology and history. She created the Zonai Survey Team, a taskforce to discover and analyse ancient documents and ruins. She appoints Tauro, a particularly keen and knowledgeable Hylian, as the leader of this team, and the group begins their research into Hyrule’s mysterious history. Ruins from the ancient Zonai can be found all across Hyrule, even during Breath of the Wild, but very little was known about them - other than the fact that they were a powerful race of magic wielders who vanished suddenly long ago. They predate even the Ancient Sheikah, the clan whose advanced technology had helped to seal the Calamity Ganon 10,000 years ago, but the truth behind them had been lost to time. This time of peace and hope wouldn’t last, however. An insidious substance known as Gloom began afflicting the people of Hyrule - causing them to fall ill after coming into contact with it. Gloom doesn’t just physically harm people, like Calamity Ganon’s Malice, it withers them. Small exposure to it can be cured with direct sunlight, but more severe contact will permanently wound or kill outright. Eventually, a secret staircase was discovered, leading into the forgotten foundations of Hyrule Castle, from which the Gloom appeared to be seeping into Hyrule. Zelda, of course, volunteered herself for the expedition. She explains that the Royal Family have always been aware of these underground chambers: when she was a child, she asked her father, King Rhoam, about them, but was told that seeing them for themselves, or even discussing their existence at all, was forbidden. King Rhoam had warned her that “no one must ever venture beneath the castle - not even one of us” - a warning that had apparently been passed down through the Royal line for as long as anyone could remember. The Princess was not alone, of course. Before venturing underground, she travelled to the Korok Forest alongside Link, her sworn protector, a Hero worthy of wielding the legendary Master Sword capable of repelling evil. During the Great Calamity, the Master Sword was terribly damaged. To restore it, Zelda had left it in the care of the Deku Tree, where it rested for a hundred years while Link recovered in the Shrine of Resurrection, and Zelda used her sacred powers to keep the Calamity Ganon imprisoned within Hyrule Castle. The Deku Tree explained that the Master Sword can not only heal itself, but grow ever stronger if it is bathed in sacred power. The stronger the power, and the longer the sword is exposed to it, the greater its power: the Deku Tree believes that the sword’s true power may in fact be limitless. This is presumably how the Master Sword was healed over the course of the century before Breath of the Wild - it was bathed in the sacred energy of the Deku Tree and the Korok Forest, enough to restore it to its former strength. The Master Sword was wielded by Link during his showdown with the Calamity Ganon, used as it had been countless times before to banish the darkness that threatened Hyrule, and restore peace to the realm. Afterwards, it seems that Link once again laid the blade to rest in the Korok Forest, where it slept until he had need of it once more. Now, with a shadow once again looming over Hyrule, Link draws his sword once more, and travels into the forgotten foundations of the Castle to protect his Princess, and uncover the source of the mysterious Gloom. The pair descend, travelling deeper and deeper into the bowels of the Castle. They walk down broken staircases, and through caves littered with cracked stone, where the walls glow with an eerie light. Ominously, the blade of the Master Sword begins to glow - a sign that the pair are approaching an unseen evil. Eventually, Link and Zelda encounter ruins different to the Hylian stonework closer to the Surface. They are decorated with ancient symbols, identifying them as the work of the Zonai. According to Zelda, the Zonai were a civilisation from the distant past, who lived in the time of earliest legend. They possessed godlike powers, and had a prosperous civilisation of floating islands in the sky. Link and Zelda discover statues depicting what they believe to be Zonai individuals - strange, alien figures with long ears. The pair continue their descent until they reach a large chamber, where they’re attacked by Keese - weak monsters that are quickly obliterated by the Master Sword. This isn’t just any ordinary room, though, its walls are decorated with elaborate murals, depicting events from Hyrule’s distant past - in particular, a terrible conflict that became known as the Imprisoning War. In total, there are seven murals in this chamber, though the last three are obscured behind rocky debris. The first depicts a Zonai descending from the sky, welcomed by Hylians on the Surface below. The Zonai brings with them seven artefacts, secret stones, which can amplify the powers of whoever wields them. The second mural shows a Zonai forming a bond with a Hylian woman. According to Zelda, her ancestors, the first of Hyrule’s royal family, were born from a union with gods who had descended from the heavens. These murals imply that these gods were the Zonai, and that, together with Hylians, they had founded the Kingdom of Hyrule - Princess Zelda, then, is a distant descendant of the Zonai. The next two murals immortalise a tragedy - first, an ominous figure stealing a secret stone from the woman from the previous image, and next - the same dark figure commanding his servants in a fierce battle, a red wave of his power spreading across the land, and the blood moon glowing in the sky above. These four murals show Hyrule’s earliest history, and the outbreak of the Imprisoning War. The three hidden murals show the War’s end, which we’ll come back to later, but it’s important to remember that these obscured murals exist right at the beginning of the game: Hyrule’s ancient history is quite literally set in stone. Link and Zelda continue on from the mural room, through a dark corridor, until they emerge in the Imprisoning Chamber, and come face to face with the secret that their Kingdom was built on. A petrified figure is bent backwards in the centre of the chamber, apparently frozen in place. At his chest he is held by a glowing arm, which trails off into a spiral of blue-green energy. This is the body of Ganondorf, the same figure depicted on the murals stealing a sacred stone, and leading his army against the Kingdom of Hyrule. The Imprisoning War is named for his imprisonment: he has been trapped here, deep below the Surface, since time immemorial. As the pair approach this haunting discovery, the hand holding Ganondorf’s body twitches, then falls limp. A stone, whose teardrop shape matches that of the secret stones of the Zonai, falls from the back of the hand and onto the cold ground. Zelda taps the stone, then picks it up, before it begins to glow with a bright light. But, before she can begin to study it… the unmistakable sound of a heartbeat echoes through the chamber. Horrified, the Princess can only watch as the body begins to twitch and convulse, cracking with the first movement after countless aeons of imprisonment. It almost rights itself, then drops back, its head hanging upside down… before it snaps towards the pair, and its eyes light up, burning with an insatiable, timeless hatred. Great tendrils of concentrated Gloom explode from Ganondorf’s chest, flooding the chamber and lunging directly at the Princess. But Link meets it with the Master Sword, jumping in front of Zelda and parrying back the evil. But this foe is beyond anything they have encountered before. The Gloom rushes forward once more, crawling down the Master Sword’s blade and onto Link’s arm, severely wounding him. It’s worth mentioning that this Link is already an accomplished Hero - here, he is at the peak of his power, after being trained and augmented by the Trials of the Ancient Sheikah during Breath of the Wild. During this opening segment, he has three full Stamina wheels and a total of 30 hearts… but not for long. The Gloom shatters Link’s strength, reducing his hearts back down to three - the same amount he had when he awoke from the Shrine of Resurrection, his body weak and his mind wiped. Not only this, the Gloom burns right through Link’s Champion’s Tunic and horrifically wounds his right arm, leaving it scarred and glowing with dark energy. Even the holy Master Sword - a weapon designed by the Goddess Hylia specifically to oppose evil - is not immune to it, and the blade is stained with Gloom. A final tendril rushes towards the pair, and Link once again tries to parry it… but this time, it’s too much. The Master Sword breaks - half of the blade splinters into tiny, sacred shards. One piece, however, flies towards Ganondorf - narrowly missing his neck and running across his cheek. It cuts into ancient flesh, and his blood begins to boil, but no more. The Blade of Evil’s Bane is broken, leaving only a single scratch on the Demon King. For the first time in millennia beyond counting, Ganondorf speaks. Somehow, Ganondorf knows both Link and Zelda by name. He claims that someone named Rauru had placed his faith in Link, and mocks him for his weakness. He arches back, and releases a final wave of Gloom - this time upwards, towards the cave’s ceiling. It pushes an ancient stone block, and the cave begins to collapse around them… and on the Surface, Hyrule Castle itself begins to rise into the air. Finally freed of his imprisonment, Ganondorf allows himself to fall into the endless blackness below. Exhausted, Link drops to one knee, and before Zelda can come to his aid… the floor beneath her gives way. Zelda drops into the same dark pit where Ganondorf had vanished, and Link, without a second thought for his injury, leaps after her. But he misses. Zelda falls, helpless… until a golden light envelops her, and she disappears. This is where the Princess and the Hero are separated, and the story of Tears of the Kingdom splits in two. Link is caught mid-air by the hand that had previously held Ganondorf, and pulled upwards into the light, where he eventually awakens on the Great Sky Island. Zelda, however, wakes up dazed and confused on what appears to be the Surface of Hyrule - though, it isn’t the Hyrule she knows. Instead, Zelda finds that she has somehow been transported to Hyrule’s distant past - to a time not long after the Kingdom’s founding. Here, ages removed from her own time, she uncovers the mysteries of the Ancient Zonai, and becomes the central part of this game’s cyclical narrative by setting up the events that will eventually occur for Link, who remains in the present day. Zelda is woken by two strange individuals: a couple who claim to be King Rauru and Queen Sonia, the first rulers of the Kingdom of Hyrule. Zelda is, of course, Hyrule’s Princess, the daughter of King Rhoam Bosphoramus Hyrule, which can mean only one thing: she has been transported to a time so far back in the past, it has become legend. King Rauru and Queen Sonia are the figures depicted on this mural: theirs was the union that the Kingdom of Hyrule was built upon. This means that Sonia is a Hyrulean woman, and Rauru is a Zonai. It’s worth noting that it doesn’t seem that this figure on the mural is Rauru specifically - we’re told later on that he is one of only two remaining Zonai, and it was his ancestors who had descended to the Surface, bringing seven secret stones with them, long long ago. So, even though Zelda has been transported to the distant past, it’s still a long time after the golden age of the Zonai: even this far back, their civilisation is ancient and shrouded in mystery. The only Zonai left are Rauru and his older sister, Mineru. They are tall, animal people, with incredibly long ears. It was said that Hylians had long, pointed ears so that they could hear the voices of the gods. Both of the Zonai are magical in different ways. Mineru can separate her spirit from her body, but Rauru has the power of Light: a sacred force that can repel and destroy evil. They both have a third eye on their foreheads, representing their enlightenment, that opens when they wield their magic powers. Sonia’s appearance closely resembles Zelda’s: in fact, she claims that she can sense a blood connection between Zelda and herself and King Rauru. She can also sense that Zelda possesses not only the power to control time, like Sonia herself, but also Rauru’s power of light. This means that Zelda is the distant descendant of this couple - the very first members of the Hyrulean Royal Family. We never see any of the couple’s children in-game, but the very fact that Zelda is descended from them, and what happens to them later on in the story, means that their children must already exist somewhere, and would go on to continue this bloodline through the ages, all the way up until the birth of this Princess Zelda. Zelda explains to the King and Queen that, in her time, something terrible is happening, but that she does not know how she got here, or how to get back to the future. Sonia advises her not to panic, to come back with them to the castle, where they can come up with a plan. Rauru suggests that Mineru, the only other remaining Zonai, may be able to help. At this point in history, the Great Plateau appears to have been the centre of the Kingdom of Hyrule. In Breath of the Wild, the Old Man describes this place as “the birthplace of the Kingdom of Hyrule”, and it seems that this is true for the Kingdom founded by Rauru and Sonia. A different Temple of Time, one built by the Zonai, is found in its place on the Plateau, and it seems that this era’s Hyrule Castle is found nearby, too. Breath of the Wild’s Hyrule Castle does not yet exist: Rauru and Sonia’s Castle is built here on the Great Plateau. In this time period, Hyrule appears largely uncharted, and untamed. Aside from the Great Plateau, the main island of civilisation, this Hyrule is even wilder than the one we know: central Hyrule is a forest, rather than a field. Death Mountain features a smoke ring, much like its appearance in Ocarina of Time, and the Duelling Peaks are, at this point, still one mountain. According to legend, the peaks were created when a dragon split a single mountain in two - a legend that seems to be true. Rauru’s Hyrule is defended with Shrines of Light - mystical stones that glow with spirals of green energy. In the early days of the Kingdom, Hyrule was plagued by monsters, which assaulted and terrorised its people. In response, Rauru and Sonia built Shrines to imprison the evil - each of them work somehow as holy seals to keep Hyrule safe. In this time period, Shrines of Light are found in different places to the ones Link will eventually encounter, thousands of years in the future, like the ones that defend the Great Plateau. Another purpose of the Shrines of Light is to illuminate the terrifying darkness below Hyrule: the Depths. Far below the surface lies a dark world, a warped reflection of the world above completely without light. That is, except for the Lightroots - treelike structures that are found directly below Shrines on the surface. The name of each Lightroot is just the name of the Shrine above it in reverse, and they are activated by Zonai magic. It’s likely that Rauru and Sonia created the Lightroots to illuminate the Depths. During this time, a chamberlain was appointed to record accounts of the lives of the King and Queen, to preserve their stories for discovery in the future. These give insight into the history and personality of the Royal couple. We learn that Sonia was once a priestess, born on the Surface. She is exceptionally intelligent, moreso than even King Rauru, who values her wisdom and insight on matters large and small. The King himself was jovial, with an easy laugh: he often set aside his Royal duties in favour of hunting, only returning to his responsibilities when sought out and scolded by Sonia. After her sudden appearance in this time, Zelda is welcomed into King Rauru’s Castle, and given new clothes by Queen Sonia. But she is still focused solely on finding a way to return to her own time, and so, Rauru accompanies her to meet his older sister, Mineru. Like Zelda, Mineru is a keen researcher. Her study is filled with books, and she’s said to become so engrossed in them that she forgets to eat. Mineru has a particular fascination with Zonai Constructs. They are described as vessels for the spirit when the body fails, so with her ability to separate her spirit from her body, she hopes that she can extend her life. She would eventually show Zelda her greatest work: a giant mecha. Rauru’s spirit later claims to have overseen the creation of Constructs: from Culinary Constructs to Soldiers. They are all powered by the same strands of green energy: perhaps they, too, are vessels for spirits in some way. The creation and maintenance of this technology required a lot of energy, which was mined in the Depths. Huge mines were found in all corners of the world, deep underneath every town. There, Constructs mined for Zonaite: a luminous mineral that can be processed into Charges. We’re only told that Zonaite contains a “mysterious energy” - but, considering that it is mostly found in the Depths, a realm of the dead, this energy could be connected to spirits, similar to Luminous Stones, said to contain the souls of the dead. Mineru shows a particular interest in Zelda’s Purah Pad. She notes that it definitely is not of her era - and asks to borrow it for a while, to attempt to restore its teleportation function, and to research the device further. She hands the device to a nearby Steward Construct, who shelves it away. Mineru, like Sonia and Rauru, possesses her own secret stone. Hers amplifies her power of spirit, Rauru’s stone strengthens his light powers, and Sonia’s her control over time. A secret stone can detect and react to an individual’s innate powers, and will change its appearance and colour to match. Once a stone is in somebody’s possession, it becomes engraved with a symbol that represents its power. These symbols are based on real-world Kanji, only stylised, and each featuring eye designs. Rauru’s stone is engraved with the symbol for Light, Mineru’s has the symbol for Spirit, and Sonia, the symbol for Time. But Zelda also possesses a stone engraved with the symbol for Time. Mineru\n",
      "Greetings, noble subject. I shall speak of Mineru with the utmost reverence, for she was a Zonai of great wisdom and power. Mineru, the sister of King Rauru, was a keen researcher and scholar, delving deep into the mysteries of Hyrule's ancient past. Her fascination with Zonai Constructs and her ability to separate her spirit from her body set her apart as a unique and formidable figure in our history.\n",

      "Consolidated Context from ChromaDB: Breath of the Wild was a game about loneliness, an amnesiac Hero uncovering the truth of his Kingdom’s collapse, learning to survive and overcome the hostile wilderness left after the Great Calamity. Its direct sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, is instead a game about connections, about bringing Hyrule’s next generation together to fight against an ancient, yet familiar evil. Both games are set in the Kingdom of Hyrule - a vast land steeped in history and legend. The story of this Kingdom stretches back thousands upon thousands of years, though many details from its histories have been eroded or distorted by the passage of time, or even lost entirely. Breath of the Wild explains that Hyrule’s history is inextricably linked with the story of the Calamity Ganon - a primal evil that has appeared time and time again. An ancient legend tells of a war 10,000 years ago, where an emergence of the Calamity had been repelled by a Hero, a Princess, and the power of the Sheikah tribe. This nightmare returned a century before Breath of the Wild - a terrible, apocalyptic event that resulted in the death of the King, and the destruction of most of the Kingdom. The Calamity was eventually defeated by Link, a Hylian Knight, after recovering for a hundred years in the Shrine of Resurrection. Very little is known about the Calamity. Ancient texts suggest that it was once a Gerudo man, but now is more akin to a force of nature: it does not communicate - it can’t be bargained with, and it wants nothing but the destruction of the Kingdom. Every time it appears, it appears from the same place - directly underneath Hyrule Castle itself. After destroying the Calamity together, Zelda spent the next few years rebuilding Hyrule, accompanied always by her Chosen Knight, Link. She moves into the house Link bought in Hateno Village where she oversees the construction of a school to educate Hyrule’s next generation. To do this, she employs Bolson, the old head Carpenter, who has since passed the torch to Hudson, our beloved President of what is now called Hudson Construction. With Hudson’s help, Hyrule began the monumental task of restoring what they had lost to the Calamity. The President not only worked to expand Tarrey Town in Akkala, he also built a new fortification over the Sacred Grounds just south of the Castle: Lookout Landing, which quickly became a thriving community at the centre of the country. His company set up resource caches all across the land: he was at the centre of a civilisation just beginning to piece itself back together. Ganon itself is once again fading into myth. Children are born and grow up believing the Calamity to be little more than a fairy tale. And, to be fair to the children, almost every single relic of the Ancient Sheikah was hidden or destroyed after the Calamity’s defeat - the Divine Beasts, Guardian shells and Shrines all removed from the land. It’s possible that some of the old technology was processed for parts - used in the construction of Skyview Towers. These were designed by the Sheikah scientist Purah and built by none other than Hudson Construction, intended to survey their surroundings and provide accurate map data. Purah, and the other Sheikah scientist, Robbie, had been in the Royal Family’s service since before the Great Calamity - responsible for all manner of research into ancient technology. And after Calamity Ganon was defeated, they put their minds to Zelda’s restoration project: eventually constructing the Purah Pad. This device is entirely different to the Sheikah Slate used by Link in Breath of the Wild, which was over 10,000 years old by that point: this one is much newer - a tool designed to help Zelda with her work. A prototype had been built by Robbie, then the device was refined and improved by both scientists, including the addition of the Camera Rune. Purah wonders if there will be a time when everyone in Hyrule carries their very own Purah Pad. We knew from Purah’s Diary in Breath of the Wild that she already possessed her own Sheikah Slate even back then, and used it to install and experiment with an Anti-Aging Rune. Like Robbie, Purah is well over a century old - but prior to the events of Breath of the Wild, performed an experiment that resulted in her reverting to the appearance of a small child. At some point after that game, she became fed up of being treated as a child, and of needing jet packs to reach high places, so adjusted her device, accelerating her development until she resembled a twenty year old woman. Zelda wasn’t only interested in technology, but archaeology and history. She created the Zonai Survey Team, a taskforce to discover and analyse ancient documents and ruins. She appoints Tauro, a particularly keen and knowledgeable Hylian, as the leader of this team, and the group begins their research into Hyrule’s mysterious history. Ruins from the ancient Zonai can be found all across Hyrule, even during Breath of the Wild, but very little was known about them - other than the fact that they were a powerful race of magic wielders who vanished suddenly long ago. They predate even the Ancient Sheikah, the clan whose advanced technology had helped to seal the Calamity Ganon 10,000 years ago, but the truth behind them had been lost to time. This time of peace and hope wouldn’t last, however. An insidious substance known as Gloom began afflicting the people of Hyrule - causing them to fall ill after coming into contact with it. Gloom doesn’t just physically harm people, like Calamity Ganon’s Malice, it withers them. Small exposure to it can be cured with direct sunlight, but more severe contact will permanently wound or kill outright. Eventually, a secret staircase was discovered, leading into the forgotten foundations of Hyrule Castle, from which the Gloom appeared to be seeping into Hyrule. Zelda, of course, volunteered herself for the expedition. She explains that the Royal Family have always been aware of these underground chambers: when she was a child, she asked her father, King Rhoam, about them, but was told that seeing them for themselves, or even discussing their existence at all, was forbidden. King Rhoam had warned her that “no one must ever venture beneath the castle - not even one of us” - a warning that had apparently been passed down through the Royal line for as long as anyone could remember. The Princess was not alone, of course. Before venturing underground, she travelled to the Korok Forest alongside Link, her sworn protector, a Hero worthy of wielding the legendary Master Sword capable of repelling evil. During the Great Calamity, the Master Sword was terribly damaged. To restore it, Zelda had left it in the care of the Deku Tree, where it rested for a hundred years while Link recovered in the Shrine of Resurrection, and Zelda used her sacred powers to keep the Calamity Ganon imprisoned within Hyrule Castle. The Deku Tree explained that the Master Sword can not only heal itself, but grow ever stronger if it is bathed in sacred power. The stronger the power, and the longer the sword is exposed to it, the greater its power: the Deku Tree believes that the sword’s true power may in fact be limitless. This is presumably how the Master Sword was healed over the course of the century before Breath of the Wild - it was bathed in the sacred energy of the Deku Tree and the Korok Forest, enough to restore it to its former strength. The Master Sword was wielded by Link during his showdown with the Calamity Ganon, used as it had been countless times before to banish the darkness that threatened Hyrule, and restore peace to the realm. Afterwards, it seems that Link once again laid the blade to rest in the Korok Forest, where it slept until he had need of it once more. Now, with a shadow once again looming over Hyrule, Link draws his sword once more, and travels into the forgotten foundations of the Castle to protect his Princess, and uncover the source of the mysterious Gloom. The pair descend, travelling deeper and deeper into the bowels of the Castle. They walk down broken staircases, and through caves littered with cracked stone, where the walls glow with an eerie light. Ominously, the blade of the Master Sword begins to glow - a sign that the pair are approaching an unseen evil. Eventually, Link and Zelda encounter ruins different to the Hylian stonework closer to the Surface. They are decorated with ancient symbols, identifying them as the work of the Zonai. According to Zelda, the Zonai were a civilisation from the distant past, who lived in the time of earliest legend. They possessed godlike powers, and had a prosperous civilisation of floating islands in the sky. Link and Zelda discover statues depicting what they believe to be Zonai individuals - strange, alien figures with long ears. The pair continue their descent until they reach a large chamber, where they’re attacked by Keese - weak monsters that are quickly obliterated by the Master Sword. This isn’t just any ordinary room, though, its walls are decorated with elaborate murals, depicting events from Hyrule’s distant past - in particular, a terrible conflict that became known as the Imprisoning War. In total, there are seven murals in this chamber, though the last three are obscured behind rocky debris. The first depicts a Zonai descending from the sky, welcomed by Hylians on the Surface below. The Zonai brings with them seven artefacts, secret stones, which can amplify the powers of whoever wields them. The second mural shows a Zonai forming a bond with a Hylian woman. According to Zelda, her ancestors, the first of Hyrule’s royal family, were born from a union with gods who had descended from the heavens. These murals imply that these gods were the Zonai, and that, together with Hylians, they had founded the Kingdom of Hyrule - Princess Zelda, then, is a distant descendant of the Zonai. The next two murals immortalise a tragedy - first, an ominous figure stealing a secret stone from the woman from the previous image, and next - the same dark figure commanding his servants in a fierce battle, a red wave of his power spreading across the land, and the blood moon glowing in the sky above. These four murals show Hyrule’s earliest history, and the outbreak of the Imprisoning War. The three hidden murals show the War’s end, which we’ll come back to later, but it’s important to remember that these obscured murals exist right at the beginning of the game: Hyrule’s ancient history is quite literally set in stone. Link and Zelda continue on from the mural room, through a dark corridor, until they emerge in the Imprisoning Chamber, and come face to face with the secret that their Kingdom was built on. A petrified figure is bent backwards in the centre of the chamber, apparently frozen in place. At his chest he is held by a glowing arm, which trails off into a spiral of blue-green energy. This is the body of Ganondorf, the same figure depicted on the murals stealing a sacred stone, and leading his army against the Kingdom of Hyrule. The Imprisoning War is named for his imprisonment: he has been trapped here, deep below the Surface, since time immemorial. As the pair approach this haunting discovery, the hand holding Ganondorf’s body twitches, then falls limp. A stone, whose teardrop shape matches that of the secret stones of the Zonai, falls from the back of the hand and onto the cold ground. Zelda taps the stone, then picks it up, before it begins to glow with a bright light. But, before she can begin to study it… the unmistakable sound of a heartbeat echoes through the chamber. Horrified, the Princess can only watch as the body begins to twitch and convulse, cracking with the first movement after countless aeons of imprisonment. It almost rights itself, then drops back, its head hanging upside down… before it snaps towards the pair, and its eyes light up, burning with an insatiable, timeless hatred. Great tendrils of concentrated Gloom explode from Ganondorf’s chest, flooding the chamber and lunging directly at the Princess. But Link meets it with the Master Sword, jumping in front of Zelda and parrying back the evil. But this foe is beyond anything they have encountered before. The Gloom rushes forward once more, crawling down the Master Sword’s blade and onto Link’s arm, severely wounding him. It’s worth mentioning that this Link is already an accomplished Hero - here, he is at the peak of his power, after being trained and augmented by the Trials of the Ancient Sheikah during Breath of the Wild. During this opening segment, he has three full Stamina wheels and a total of 30 hearts… but not for long. The Gloom shatters Link’s strength, reducing his hearts back down to three - the same amount he had when he awoke from the Shrine of Resurrection, his body weak and his mind wiped. Not only this, the Gloom burns right through Link’s Champion’s Tunic and horrifically wounds his right arm, leaving it scarred and glowing with dark energy. Even the holy Master Sword - a weapon designed by the Goddess Hylia specifically to oppose evil - is not immune to it, and the blade is stained with Gloom. A final tendril rushes towards the pair, and Link once again tries to parry it… but this time, it’s too much. The Master Sword breaks - half of the blade splinters into tiny, sacred shards. One piece, however, flies towards Ganondorf - narrowly missing his neck and running across his cheek. It cuts into ancient flesh, and his blood begins to boil, but no more. The Blade of Evil’s Bane is broken, leaving only a single scratch on the Demon King. For the first time in millennia beyond counting, Ganondorf speaks. Somehow, Ganondorf knows both Link and Zelda by name. He claims that someone named Rauru had placed his faith in Link, and mocks him for his weakness. He arches back, and releases a final wave of Gloom - this time upwards, towards the cave’s ceiling. It pushes an ancient stone block, and the cave begins to collapse around them… and on the Surface, Hyrule Castle itself begins to rise into the air. Finally freed of his imprisonment, Ganondorf allows himself to fall into the endless blackness below. Exhausted, Link drops to one knee, and before Zelda can come to his aid… the floor beneath her gives way. Zelda drops into the same dark pit where Ganondorf had vanished, and Link, without a second thought for his injury, leaps after her. But he misses. Zelda falls, helpless… until a golden light envelops her, and she disappears. This is where the Princess and the Hero are separated, and the story of Tears of the Kingdom splits in two. Link is caught mid-air by the hand that had previously held Ganondorf, and pulled upwards into the light, where he eventually awakens on the Great Sky Island. Zelda, however, wakes up dazed and confused on what appears to be the Surface of Hyrule - though, it isn’t the Hyrule she knows. Instead, Zelda finds that she has somehow been transported to Hyrule’s distant past - to a time not long after the Kingdom’s founding. Here, ages removed from her own time, she uncovers the mysteries of the Ancient Zonai, and becomes the central part of this game’s cyclical narrative by setting up the events that will eventually occur for Link, who remains in the present day. Zelda is woken by two strange individuals: a couple who claim to be King Rauru and Queen Sonia, the first rulers of the Kingdom of Hyrule. Zelda is, of course, Hyrule’s Princess, the daughter of King Rhoam Bosphoramus Hyrule, which can mean only one thing: she has been transported to a time so far back in the past, it has become legend. King Rauru and Queen Sonia are the figures depicted on this mural: theirs was the union that the Kingdom of Hyrule was built upon. This means that Sonia is a Hyrulean woman, and Rauru is a Zonai. It’s worth noting that it doesn’t seem that this figure on the mural is Rauru specifically - we’re told later on that he is one of only two remaining Zonai, and it was his ancestors who had descended to the Surface, bringing seven secret stones with them, long long ago. So, even though Zelda has been transported to the distant past, it’s still a long time after the golden age of the Zonai: even this far back, their civilisation is ancient and shrouded in mystery. The only Zonai left are Rauru and his older sister, Mineru. They are tall, animal people, with incredibly long ears. It was said that Hylians had long, pointed ears so that they could hear the voices of the gods. Both of the Zonai are magical in different ways. Mineru can separate her spirit from her body, but Rauru has the power of Light: a sacred force that can repel and destroy evil. They both have a third eye on their foreheads, representing their enlightenment, that opens when they wield their magic powers. Sonia’s appearance closely resembles Zelda’s: in fact, she claims that she can sense a blood connection between Zelda and herself and King Rauru. She can also sense that Zelda possesses not only the power to control time, like Sonia herself, but also Rauru’s power of light. This means that Zelda is the distant descendant of this couple - the very first members of the Hyrulean Royal Family. We never see any of the couple’s children in-game, but the very fact that Zelda is descended from them, and what happens to them later on in the story, means that their children must already exist somewhere, and would go on to continue this bloodline through the ages, all the way up until the birth of this Princess Zelda. Zelda explains to the King and Queen that, in her time, something terrible is happening, but that she does not know how she got here, or how to get back to the future. Sonia advises her not to panic, to come back with them to the castle, where they can come up with a plan. Rauru suggests that Mineru, the only other remaining Zonai, may be able to help. At this point in history, the Great Plateau appears to have been the centre of the Kingdom of Hyrule. In Breath of the Wild, the Old Man describes this place as “the birthplace of the Kingdom of Hyrule”, and it seems that this is true for the Kingdom founded by Rauru and Sonia. A different Temple of Time, one built by the Zonai, is found in its place on the Plateau, and it seems that this era’s Hyrule Castle is found nearby, too. Breath of the Wild’s Hyrule Castle does not yet exist: Rauru and Sonia’s Castle is built here on the Great Plateau. In this time period, Hyrule appears largely uncharted, and untamed. Aside from the Great Plateau, the main island of civilisation, this Hyrule is even wilder than the one we know: central Hyrule is a forest, rather than a field. Death Mountain features a smoke ring, much like its appearance in Ocarina of Time, and the Duelling Peaks are, at this point, still one mountain. According to legend, the peaks were created when a dragon split a single mountain in two - a legend that seems to be true. Rauru’s Hyrule is defended with Shrines of Light - mystical stones that glow with spirals of green energy. In the early days of the Kingdom, Hyrule was plagued by monsters, which assaulted and terrorised its people. In response, Rauru and Sonia built Shrines to imprison the evil - each of them work somehow as holy seals to keep Hyrule safe. In this time period, Shrines of Light are found in different places to the ones Link will eventually encounter, thousands of years in the future, like the ones that defend the Great Plateau. Another purpose of the Shrines of Light is to illuminate the terrifying darkness below Hyrule: the Depths. Far below the surface lies a dark world, a warped reflection of the world above completely without light. That is, except for the Lightroots - treelike structures that are found directly below Shrines on the surface. The name of each Lightroot is just the name of the Shrine above it in reverse, and they are activated by Zonai magic. It’s likely that Rauru and Sonia created the Lightroots to illuminate the Depths. During this time, a chamberlain was appointed to record accounts of the lives of the King and Queen, to preserve their stories for discovery in the future. These give insight into the history and personality of the Royal couple. We learn that Sonia was once a priestess, born on the Surface. She is exceptionally intelligent, moreso than even King Rauru, who values her wisdom and insight on matters large and small. The King himself was jovial, with an easy laugh: he often set aside his Royal duties in favour of hunting, only returning to his responsibilities when sought out and scolded by Sonia. After her sudden appearance in this time, Zelda is welcomed into King Rauru’s Castle, and given new clothes by Queen Sonia. But she is still focused solely on finding a way to return to her own time, and so, Rauru accompanies her to meet his older sister, Mineru. Like Zelda, Mineru is a keen researcher. Her study is filled with books, and she’s said to become so engrossed in them that she forgets to eat. Mineru has a particular fascination with Zonai Constructs. They are described as vessels for the spirit when the body fails, so with her ability to separate her spirit from her body, she hopes that she can extend her life. She would eventually show Zelda her greatest work: a giant mecha. Rauru’s spirit later claims to have overseen the creation of Constructs: from Culinary Constructs to Soldiers. They are all powered by the same strands of green energy: perhaps they, too, are vessels for spirits in some way. The creation and maintenance of this technology required a lot of energy, which was mined in the Depths. Huge mines were found in all corners of the world, deep underneath every town. There, Constructs mined for Zonaite: a luminous mineral that can be processed into Charges. We’re only told that Zonaite contains a “mysterious energy” - but, considering that it is mostly found in the Depths, a realm of the dead, this energy could be connected to spirits, similar to Luminous Stones, said to contain the souls of the dead. Mineru shows a particular interest in Zelda’s Purah Pad. She notes that it definitely is not of her era - and asks to borrow it for a while, to attempt to restore its teleportation function, and to research the device further. She hands the device to a nearby Steward Construct, who shelves it away. Mineru, like Sonia and Rauru, possesses her own secret stone. Hers amplifies her power of spirit, Rauru’s stone strengthens his light powers, and Sonia’s her control over time. A secret stone can detect and react to an individual’s innate powers, and will change its appearance and colour to match. Once a stone is in somebody’s possession, it becomes engraved with a symbol that represents its power. These symbols are based on real-world Kanji, only stylised, and each featuring eye designs. Rauru’s stone is engraved with the symbol for Light, Mineru’s has the symbol for Spirit, and Sonia, the symbol for Time. But Zelda also possesses a stone engraved with the symbol for Time. Mineru\n",

      "Consolidated Context from ChromaDB: his bidding. This Phantom Ganon is apparently made from the Demon King’s own flesh and blood. It’s also very similar to the Sage Avatars that follow Link: which are projections of a Sage’s spirit made possible by the possession of a secret stone, only Phantom Ganon is a blood red, to reflect Ganondorf’s power of Darkness and gloom. Echoing his battle against the Calamity - Link locks blades with the Phantom in the Castle’s throne room - destroying mirror images of the demon, and dodging and parrying strikes from its Gloom weapons. Eventually, it falls: Ganondorf admits defeat. But not completely. Phantom Ganon explodes into a cluster of Gloom, which then lunges towards Link in four great tendrils - exactly like those which had injured him beneath the castle. He braces for the impact… but this time, he is not alone. The spectre of Ganondorf is surprised that this group, each bearing a secret stone, does not recognise him, and muses that there must be limits to the knowledge that the stones impart. He claims that the Sages’ ancestors had only delayed his ascension, and, as his secret stone of darkness glows, he shows a vision: of the world as it was before Rauru founded Hyrule, the world he would create again. This world of chaos is exactly what Ganondorf wants to return to: a land that values and rewards power above all else - where fighting spirit, courage and vigour are essential for survival. He claims that the Sages need only wait for his minions to sweep over the land, then vanishes - fading away into particles of Gloom. The Sages convene: this was the man the Ancient Sages had warned them about, who had nearly destroyed the world long ago. Riju notes, however, that he must not yet be at his full strength: otherwise none of them would still be alive. Hyrule Castle had proved to be a diversion: little more than the stopper on the seal forced upward when Ganondorf broke free. Once again the heart of the Kingdom was twisted into a symbol of his dominion over the land, but this time, it was nothing more. The Demon King lay dormant beneath the ground, gathering his strength. The search for Ganondorf had begun. Ever since Link and Zelda had ventured below the Castle to investigate the Gloom, Hyrule had been a land without a ruler - desperately searching for any sign of its missing Princess. And, since the Upheaval, there was hope: reports of sightings of Zelda came in from all across the country - of the Princess visiting stables and villages, even Hyrule Castle itself. But when Link, and the Sages he had awakened from each of the four regions, had stormed the floating citadel, they had uncovered the truth: this was not Hyrule’s Princess, but Ganondorf himself: a phantom conjured by his power, designed to sabotage and manipulate Hyrule from the inside. Ganondorf’s puppet had been responsible for all of the regional phenomena, and had appeared at Hyrule Castle specifically to lure Link into a trap. And, this would have worked: Link would have once again fallen victim to the terrible Gloom, were it not for the intervention of the Sages. The mystery of the actual Princess Zelda’s disappearance had only grown deeper, but the truth of the Upheaval itself was now clear to everyone: it had been caused by the return of Ganondorf, the Demon King from the legend of the Imprisoning War. News of the Demon King’s return spread like wildfire - printed on the front page of newspapers, and muttered under the breath of stable owners. Link and the Sages convene with Purah at Lookout Landing to form a plan. They are all now aware of the identity of Puppet Zelda, and that the real Zelda must have travelled somehow to the distant past - as when each of them had awakened as a Sage, they had seen visions of the confrontation with Ganondorf, and of their predecessors talking to Princess Zelda. They know that Zelda had come up with a plan to defeat the Demon King - that they were destined to fight alongside Link now he has returned in the present day. But other than that, they don’t know anything about Ganondorf, his story or his goals, other than that he is “bad news and super strong.” Purah notices that, when the Sages told her of the visions they had seen of the distant past, there had been six sages supporting King Rauru in the battle: Wind, Fire, Water, Lightning, Time, but also Spirit: Mineru. Purah notes that each of the Sages present had awoken at ancient ruins from the time of King Rauru, and guesses that Mineru might be found in a similar place. The group splits up to search for clues: Tulin, Yunobo, Sidon and Riju return to their regions to hunt there, but Link instead heads towards the home of the Sheikah: Kakariko Village. Ever since the Upheaval, Zelda’s Zonai Survey Team had been investigating strange, ring-shaped ruins that had fallen directly on top of Kakariko Village. During Breath of the Wild, the chief of Kakariko Village had been Impa - a royal advisor to the King and Queen before the Great Calamity. Like Purah and Robbie, by the time of the game, she is around 120 years old. The Sheikah are notably longer-lived than Hylians, so even at this age she was able to serve as the village’s chief: but at some point after the fall of Calamity Ganon, she decided to pass the torch to her granddaughter, Paya. One day, Impa suddenly announced that Paya would take over her duties - and instead began researching old books in the village. Paya was blindsided by the announcement: she didn’t yet feel ready for such a responsibility, and felt that her grandmother’s chief’s hat was too heavy for her head. When the Upheaval happened, and the ring ruins rained down on Kakariko, Impa suddenly announced that she planned to leave. Together with Cado, she packed her bags: Paya pleaded for her to stay, but Impa insisted that an event like the Upheaval was precisely the reason she must go. The new chief conceded, and bid her grandmother farewell: but not before noticing something in her eyes that said that she was embarking on some great mission. Paya later looked through the books Impa had been reading, and discovered eleven strange symbols inside: symbols which she believes are related to Impa’s quest. The books Impa had been reading concerned the Geoglyphs: eleven symbols which had mysteriously appeared on Hyrule’s surface since the Upheaval. If viewed from high above, these giant symbols become clear: from the Master Sword to a Secret Stone or the Purah Pad. For this reason, Impa and Cado travel across the land in a hot air balloon given to them by Purah: providing them with the altitude necessary to properly study these markings. Each geoglyph makes use of many teardrop shapes - and these hold a secret. One teardrop contains a Dragon’s Tear - a small, circular pool. These Dragon’s Tears are the spots where the Light Dragon’s actual tears fell, right after Zelda transformed: she shed memories of her time in the distant past that became embedded in the land at these sacred sites. When Link interacts with the pool, he experiences a vision: a memory from Zelda’s time in the distant past. These Dragon’s Tears, then, have existed for millennia. Ancient people found these sites, and they, too, experienced visions of Zelda’s past. Impa claims that a passage found in old literature from Kakariko Village describes this: and notes that a group of people in the distant past, possibly Sheikah themselves, marked these sites with images depicting what they saw in the visions. Interestingly, these ancient people must have also had some ability to control time: Link is only able to see the visions as the Tears react with his Recall ability. At some point, a chamber was built in the back of the Forgotten Temple to catalogue these glyphs - a great map of the Kingdom, with each symbol marked on the wall surrounding it. We can tell that this chamber was built sometime after the construction of Hyrule Castle over the seal, as the castle is represented on the map. The room just before this was the very place where Rauru had planned Hyrule’s defence, and granted the Sages with the secret stones - and even now, thousands of years later, Link can find a stone marking Sonia’s grave, where Rauru once grieved. Interestingly, Sonia’s gravestone is surrounded by Sundelion flowers - which grow on Sky Islands and can cure the effects of Gloom - perhaps the Sundelion somehow represented Sonia, just like how the Silent Princess represents her distant descendant, Zelda - whose story is immortalised in the next room. For whatever reason, these geoglyphs weren’t visible until after the Upheaval: the recent events triggered something and caused them to appear. Ganondorf’s return causing the appearance of the glyphs seems to have been part of the plan of whoever created them: Paya notes that Impa left Kakariko immediately after the Upheaval - cryptically noting that times like these are exactly why she must leave. Just like Breath of the Wild, Link again ventures across the Kingdom, piecing together a story from a distant age, piece by piece. Collecting the tears of a deity is a staple in the Zelda series: Link has previously collected sacred tears in Skyward Sword’s Silent Realms and the Light Tears in Twilight Princess. A teardrop specifically containing information was seen in Breath of the Wild with the Ancient Sheikah technology: if it was Impa’s Sheikah ancestors who found the tears of the Light Dragon and created geoglyphs around them, perhaps this in turn inspired something about the tribe’s symbols, just like how the Ancient Sages and their Temples went on to inspire the designs of the Sheikah Divine Beasts. Only after he’s recovered all of the Dragon’s Tears’ memories does Link uncover the truth about Princess Zelda. Upon seeing the final vision, the Light Dragon appears above Link: and from it falls a single tear, landing in the centre of the Rist Peninsula. This final Dragon’s Tear is formed from Zelda’s memory of becoming the Light Dragon, revealing to Link her terrible fate. As Link wakes from the final memory, the Light Dragon roars and circles above his head - and the Hero finds the area where the Tear fell full of Silent Princess flowers: Zelda’s flowers. Not only does he now know the sinister identity of the Princess since the Upheaval, he now knows the truth about the real Princess’s sacrifice. He has found his Zelda, but she is lost - trapped forever in a body not her own. But Link’s quest must continue - he must find the fifth Sage, and bring the fight to the Demon King. After Impa had left Kakariko to search for the geoglyphs, Paya had informed Purah of the Ring Ruins that had landed on her village, who claimed that Zonai ruins shaped like this are incredibly unusual. Paya then contacted the Zonai Survey Team, who in turn travelled to the village to investigate. It was soon discovered that each Ring contained stone slabs marked with Zonai text - fascinating discoveries that were translated by Tauro, head of the ZST. He learned that each described details about the Ancient Sages, the secret stones, and the Imprisoning War. A fifth ring ruin was found directly above Kakariko Village’s north gate, ominously suspended in the air. But Ganondorf had sent his phantom saboteur to the Sheikah’s hometown, too - according to Paya, Princess Zelda herself had travelled to Kakariko to inspect the ruins that had fallen there. She had ordered that the floating ruin was off limits, without expressing any concern for the wellbeing of the villagers. The Ring Ruins breathe new life into the Sheikah’s hometown. Researchers and tourists alike pour into the village, having travelled from all corners of Hyrule to see, or even study, the mysterious relics from a forgotten civilisation that have rained down on Kakariko. Dorian’s youngest daughter, Koko, sets up a little shop selling Ring Garlands to celebrate this occasion. Dr. Calip, a researcher who originally lived in a hut near Fort Hateno before joining the ZST, is responsible for restricting access to the floating Ring Ruin: which he does with irritating efficiency. Only after destroying the phantom in the castle and explaining the truth about puppet Zelda to Paya does Calip let up, allowing Link to Ascend into the floating ruin and photograph the stone slab inside for Tauro to translate. The head of the Survey Team isn’t able to fully translate the slab, but what he can make out tells of Mineru, and mentions a key, hidden in the south east - finally, a clue to the location of the missing Sage. Paya, who had been learning how to decipher Zonai script since the Upheaval, is able to contribute to Tauro’s translation: adding that the slab appears to mention “the dragon land”. She suggests that they search in the Faron region, a place connected with the Ancient Zonai found in the southeast: known as the Zonai Ruins. Before the Upheaval and the emergence of the Sky Islands, this was the largest, and perhaps most mysterious, Zonai site left on Hyrule’s Surface. Great walls and statues are built along the winding Dracozu River, the serpentine shape of which inspired the ancient song called “The Serpent’s Jaws”. The Zonai Ruins were where the mystery of this lost tribe began in Breath of the Wild, and, fittingly, it’s where the mystery ends in Tears of the Kingdom. The Zonai Survey Team moves to the Faron region, and Paya’s translation is proven correct: together with Calip and Tauro, Link uncovers a sequence of ancient chambers containing the Charged robes: a set once used in ancient rituals, presumably designed to worship Farosh, the Lightning Dragon who is often spotted in the skies directly above this region. The Zonai Ruins in Faron are another location that appears to have changed since the Upheaval: new, taller dragon statues appear, built from the same smooth white stone as the Sky Islands, rather than the weathered stone of the rest of the surface ruins. Like the appearance of the islands themselves, and the emergence of the Geoglyphs around the Dragon's Tears, it seems that Ganondorf’s resurrection triggered a response from Ancient Zonai sites: opening pathways for the Hero that Zelda had promised. The Zonai Ruins’ new statues reveal their secret when struck by lightning: they disperse the eternal thunderstorm that cloaks the islands above this region, allowing Link to make his way to Dragonhead Island, and find Mineru’s mask. This owl-shaped device was developed by Mineru in the distant past - seen here when she talks to Zelda. Somehow, it reacts to the presence of Mineru’s spirit inside the Purah Pad, and the Sage of Spirit is able to speak: she guides Link first to the Surface, and then into the endless Depths below. Of course, Mineru had decided to join Zelda in her plan to reach the future: instead of consuming her secret stone and draconifying, she instead transferred her spirit to the Purah Pad, which was guarded by a Steward Construct on the Great Sky Island until it was given to Link. Mineru had intended to awaken alongside Zelda’s Knight, but, like with the four regional phenomena, Ganondorf had focused some of his power on stopping the re-emergence of the Sage of Spirit, too. Link brings the mask to the Construct Factory, where Mineru once created machines to serve as vessels for her spirit. In the distant past, she had built a colossal Construct here, and showed it to Zelda: it was so big and so powerful that the Princess was able to ride on its shoulders like riding a horse. Mineru’s original plan was to guide Link to this Construct as soon as he received the Purah Pad, but there was a problem: when Ganondorf returned, he managed to seize control of Mineru’s Construct where it lay dormant, deep underground: just like he had seized control of the Guardians and Divine Beasts during the Great Calamity. Link is instead required to gather parts from the various storehouses to built Mineru a new body: a new giant mecha, like the one she had built and showed to Zelda in the distant past, and the ultimate weapon created by the Yiga Clan. With the Construct operational, Mineru guides him to the Spirit Temple just south-east, where she had hidden away her secret stone. The platform directly before the secret stone’s chamber is soaked in Gloom - and, without warning, an electrified fence rises to trap Link and Mineru’s construct inside. A platform opens in the floor, and from it leaps Mineru’s forgotten project: the original Construct, now possessed by a different spirit: Ganondorf’s Gloom fuels it from within, twisting it into a savage killing machine. The most dangerous game of rock-em, sock-em robots begins - with Link and Mineru controlling the new Construct, and Ganondorf the Siezed Construct. Both machines bring the pinnacle of Zonai engineering to bear against one another - spiked balls and electric blades smash through ancient armour, and cannon fire shakes the subterranean Temple. Eventually, though, Link and Mineru are victorious: the Seized Construct is destroyed, opening the way to the final secret stone. Mineru’s spirit jumps out of the Purah Pad, and floats towards the Spirit Stone - which in turn jumps into the Construct body Link had just created. The fifth Sage was awakened - Mineru had returned to the battle, after thousands of years. Mineru tells Link about the story of the Imprisoning War, of Zelda the Sage of Time and of her sacrifice to empower the Master Sword. She explains that Zelda had given her a message: to tell Link to speak to the Great Deku Tree, and recover the blade of evil’s bane. It’s unclear whether or not the Great Deku Tree existed in the time of King Rauru. It doesn’t appear to be present in the same location here, or at least, if it is, it didn’t yet have such a giant spread of cherry blossom leaves. But we know that this Deku Tree is ancient, and has watched over Hyrule for countless years. Regardless of whether or not it existed yet in the distant past, Zelda was somehow able to relay a message to the Tree: perhaps she spoke to it long after her draconification, communicating with the forest deity as the Light Dragon to inform it of her plan. But the Korok Forest, and its guardian, also suffered with the return of Ganondorf. A shadowy fog clouded the Lost Woods, and the Deku Tree itself suffered a curse: a splinter of Ganondorf’s raw power tortured him from within, and the forest’s Koroks were paralysed due to their father’s condition. This is very similar to the Deku Tree’s fate in Ocarina of Time: where Ganondorf cursed it with the parasitic Queen Gohma, which also rotted the deity from the inside. But this time, Ganondorf took an even more direct approach: the Deku’s Tree’s curse was Phantom Ganon: created from the Demon King’s flesh and blood, just like the saboteur that had disguised itself as Zelda. Destroying this Phantom restores the Deku Tree’s vitality, and returns the Korok Forest to a peaceful sanctuary. Now recovered, the Deku Tree can speak to Link for the first time since before the Upheaval: the time when Link and Zelda had travelled to the Forest to retrieve the Master Sword. The Deku Tree notes that Link no longer has it, but claims that he can sense the blade: In the head of the Light Dragon, where it has been for thousands of years. After healing the Deku Tree and learning of the Master Sword’s fate, Link finds that the Light Dragon has lowered its altitude. Almost as if it knows that Link is searching for it, it begins to fly much closer to the surface - allowing the Hero to jump from the heavens and land on its back, clinging to the Master Sword for dear life. The Light Dragon screams and writhes its body, trying to shake Link, like the very act of touching the blade causes it pain. It swings its head violently from side to side, but, by this point, Link has recovered enough of his lost vitality to hold on - desperately, until… the Dragon subsides, and glides, silently, higher and higher. After a flash of light, Link finds himself in a realm of golden skies - only white clouds and sunbeams break up the heavenly space. The Light Dragon’s hair uncoils from the blade - allowing Link to gently remove it. The blade that was broken shall return to Hyrule. A vision appears to Link of the Princess, floating in a sea of white light, pouring her power into the blade. Interestingly, the back of her right hand glows with a bright golden light - and it’s this light that flows into the sword, repairing it. When Zelda used her sealing powers in Breath of the Wild, it was represented by the mark of the Triforce appearing on her hand: it seems like the same thing happens here, as she directs this sacred Light directly into the sword that seals the darkness. The Master Sword itself has been transformed by its time with the Light Dragon. Though Zelda’s power has restored the blade, the scars of Ganondorf’s attack are still visible. It seems that the sword has also been imbued with Ancient Zonai powers, too: it reacts when its wielder uses the Zonai Fuse ability - mysterious green symbols appear along the blade, and Fused materials take on a ghostly green shade. Though she had succeeded in delivering the blade to Link… Zelda’s sacrifice was permanent. She had become an eternal dragon, doomed to wander the skies forever. The Light Dragon drops Link off at the Temple of Time, then flies off, without a word, to continue her endless solitude. But Zelda had done it. Her last thoughts before she lost herself were of Link: she knew that he would arrive in the future, and protect them all. And now, with the Sages awakened again, a battle tens of thousands of years in the making could begin. Link and Purah convene for a final time at Lookout Landing. The Hero informs her of the awakening of the Sage of Spirit, and of the discovery of the Master Sword in the Light Dragon’s head. This means that Zelda’s plan from the distant past was almost complete: all that remained was finding Ganondorf himself. Purah suggests that Link not look on the Surface or the Skies above, but instead search below their feet, in the hellish Depths beneath the ground. The Depths are quite literally the underworld, a dark world that mirrors Hyrule above it. The Depths are home to Poes, lost spirits of the dead, who can be guided to the afterlife by Bargainer Statues: which are themselves dark reflections of the Goddess Statues found directly above them. The spirits of soldiers float above grave markers, offering up weapons. These are presumably soldiers who lost their lives to the Great Calamity a hundred years ago - like these three, gathered directly underneath Castle Town, at the heart of the Guardian assault. Monsters in the Depths never sleep, with the obvious exception of the Hinox. They gather in groups and mine for Zonaite - which they harvest for some unknown purpose. Pools of Gloom stain the surface, crawling with giant dark roots, pulsing with Ganondorf’s energy. Like veins, these dark roots are spread across the entire Depths, but are focused on Ganondorf’s lair, deep below the Castle. This has been apparent since the very beginning of the game, of course:\n",

      "Consolidated Context from ChromaDB: Breath of the Wild was a game about loneliness, an amnesiac Hero uncovering the truth of his Kingdom’s collapse, learning to survive and overcome the hostile wilderness left after the Great Calamity. Its direct sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, is instead a game about connections, about bringing Hyrule’s next generation together to fight against an ancient, yet familiar evil. Both games are set in the Kingdom of Hyrule - a vast land steeped in history and legend. The story of this Kingdom stretches back thousands upon thousands of years, though many details from its histories have been eroded or distorted by the passage of time, or even lost entirely. Breath of the Wild explains that Hyrule’s history is inextricably linked with the story of the Calamity Ganon - a primal evil that has appeared time and time again. An ancient legend tells of a war 10,000 years ago, where an emergence of the Calamity had been repelled by a Hero, a Princess, and the power of the Sheikah tribe. This nightmare returned a century before Breath of the Wild - a terrible, apocalyptic event that resulted in the death of the King, and the destruction of most of the Kingdom. The Calamity was eventually defeated by Link, a Hylian Knight, after recovering for a hundred years in the Shrine of Resurrection. Very little is known about the Calamity. Ancient texts suggest that it was once a Gerudo man, but now is more akin to a force of nature: it does not communicate - it can’t be bargained with, and it wants nothing but the destruction of the Kingdom. Every time it appears, it appears from the same place - directly underneath Hyrule Castle itself. After destroying the Calamity together, Zelda spent the next few years rebuilding Hyrule, accompanied always by her Chosen Knight, Link. She moves into the house Link bought in Hateno Village where she oversees the construction of a school to educate Hyrule’s next generation. To do this, she employs Bolson, the old head Carpenter, who has since passed the torch to Hudson, our beloved President of what is now called Hudson Construction. With Hudson’s help, Hyrule began the monumental task of restoring what they had lost to the Calamity. The President not only worked to expand Tarrey Town in Akkala, he also built a new fortification over the Sacred Grounds just south of the Castle: Lookout Landing, which quickly became a thriving community at the centre of the country. His company set up resource caches all across the land: he was at the centre of a civilisation just beginning to piece itself back together. Ganon itself is once again fading into myth. Children are born and grow up believing the Calamity to be little more than a fairy tale. And, to be fair to the children, almost every single relic of the Ancient Sheikah was hidden or destroyed after the Calamity’s defeat - the Divine Beasts, Guardian shells and Shrines all removed from the land. It’s possible that some of the old technology was processed for parts - used in the construction of Skyview Towers. These were designed by the Sheikah scientist Purah and built by none other than Hudson Construction, intended to survey their surroundings and provide accurate map data. Purah, and the other Sheikah scientist, Robbie, had been in the Royal Family’s service since before the Great Calamity - responsible for all manner of research into ancient technology. And after Calamity Ganon was defeated, they put their minds to Zelda’s restoration project: eventually constructing the Purah Pad. This device is entirely different to the Sheikah Slate used by Link in Breath of the Wild, which was over 10,000 years old by that point: this one is much newer - a tool designed to help Zelda with her work. A prototype had been built by Robbie, then the device was refined and improved by both scientists, including the addition of the Camera Rune. Purah wonders if there will be a time when everyone in Hyrule carries their very own Purah Pad. We knew from Purah’s Diary in Breath of the Wild that she already possessed her own Sheikah Slate even back then, and used it to install and experiment with an Anti-Aging Rune. Like Robbie, Purah is well over a century old - but prior to the events of Breath of the Wild, performed an experiment that resulted in her reverting to the appearance of a small child. At some point after that game, she became fed up of being treated as a child, and of needing jet packs to reach high places, so adjusted her device, accelerating her development until she resembled a twenty year old woman. Zelda wasn’t only interested in technology, but archaeology and history. She created the Zonai Survey Team, a taskforce to discover and analyse ancient documents and ruins. She appoints Tauro, a particularly keen and knowledgeable Hylian, as the leader of this team, and the group begins their research into Hyrule’s mysterious history. Ruins from the ancient Zonai can be found all across Hyrule, even during Breath of the Wild, but very little was known about them - other than the fact that they were a powerful race of magic wielders who vanished suddenly long ago. They predate even the Ancient Sheikah, the clan whose advanced technology had helped to seal the Calamity Ganon 10,000 years ago, but the truth behind them had been lost to time. This time of peace and hope wouldn’t last, however. An insidious substance known as Gloom began afflicting the people of Hyrule - causing them to fall ill after coming into contact with it. Gloom doesn’t just physically harm people, like Calamity Ganon’s Malice, it withers them. Small exposure to it can be cured with direct sunlight, but more severe contact will permanently wound or kill outright. Eventually, a secret staircase was discovered, leading into the forgotten foundations of Hyrule Castle, from which the Gloom appeared to be seeping into Hyrule. Zelda, of course, volunteered herself for the expedition. She explains that the Royal Family have always been aware of these underground chambers: when she was a child, she asked her father, King Rhoam, about them, but was told that seeing them for themselves, or even discussing their existence at all, was forbidden. King Rhoam had warned her that “no one must ever venture beneath the castle - not even one of us” - a warning that had apparently been passed down through the Royal line for as long as anyone could remember. The Princess was not alone, of course. Before venturing underground, she travelled to the Korok Forest alongside Link, her sworn protector, a Hero worthy of wielding the legendary Master Sword capable of repelling evil. During the Great Calamity, the Master Sword was terribly damaged. To restore it, Zelda had left it in the care of the Deku Tree, where it rested for a hundred years while Link recovered in the Shrine of Resurrection, and Zelda used her sacred powers to keep the Calamity Ganon imprisoned within Hyrule Castle. The Deku Tree explained that the Master Sword can not only heal itself, but grow ever stronger if it is bathed in sacred power. The stronger the power, and the longer the sword is exposed to it, the greater its power: the Deku Tree believes that the sword’s true power may in fact be limitless. This is presumably how the Master Sword was healed over the course of the century before Breath of the Wild - it was bathed in the sacred energy of the Deku Tree and the Korok Forest, enough to restore it to its former strength. The Master Sword was wielded by Link during his showdown with the Calamity Ganon, used as it had been countless times before to banish the darkness that threatened Hyrule, and restore peace to the realm. Afterwards, it seems that Link once again laid the blade to rest in the Korok Forest, where it slept until he had need of it once more. Now, with a shadow once again looming over Hyrule, Link draws his sword once more, and travels into the forgotten foundations of the Castle to protect his Princess, and uncover the source of the mysterious Gloom. The pair descend, travelling deeper and deeper into the bowels of the Castle. They walk down broken staircases, and through caves littered with cracked stone, where the walls glow with an eerie light. Ominously, the blade of the Master Sword begins to glow - a sign that the pair are approaching an unseen evil. Eventually, Link and Zelda encounter ruins different to the Hylian stonework closer to the Surface. They are decorated with ancient symbols, identifying them as the work of the Zonai. According to Zelda, the Zonai were a civilisation from the distant past, who lived in the time of earliest legend. They possessed godlike powers, and had a prosperous civilisation of floating islands in the sky. Link and Zelda discover statues depicting what they believe to be Zonai individuals - strange, alien figures with long ears. The pair continue their descent until they reach a large chamber, where they’re attacked by Keese - weak monsters that are quickly obliterated by the Master Sword. This isn’t just any ordinary room, though, its walls are decorated with elaborate murals, depicting events from Hyrule’s distant past - in particular, a terrible conflict that became known as the Imprisoning War. In total, there are seven murals in this chamber, though the last three are obscured behind rocky debris. The first depicts a Zonai descending from the sky, welcomed by Hylians on the Surface below. The Zonai brings with them seven artefacts, secret stones, which can amplify the powers of whoever wields them. The second mural shows a Zonai forming a bond with a Hylian woman. According to Zelda, her ancestors, the first of Hyrule’s royal family, were born from a union with gods who had descended from the heavens. These murals imply that these gods were the Zonai, and that, together with Hylians, they had founded the Kingdom of Hyrule - Princess Zelda, then, is a distant descendant of the Zonai. The next two murals immortalise a tragedy - first, an ominous figure stealing a secret stone from the woman from the previous image, and next - the same dark figure commanding his servants in a fierce battle, a red wave of his power spreading across the land, and the blood moon glowing in the sky above. These four murals show Hyrule’s earliest history, and the outbreak of the Imprisoning War. The three hidden murals show the War’s end, which we’ll come back to later, but it’s important to remember that these obscured murals exist right at the beginning of the game: Hyrule’s ancient history is quite literally set in stone. Link and Zelda continue on from the mural room, through a dark corridor, until they emerge in the Imprisoning Chamber, and come face to face with the secret that their Kingdom was built on. A petrified figure is bent backwards in the centre of the chamber, apparently frozen in place. At his chest he is held by a glowing arm, which trails off into a spiral of blue-green energy. This is the body of Ganondorf, the same figure depicted on the murals stealing a sacred stone, and leading his army against the Kingdom of Hyrule. The Imprisoning War is named for his imprisonment: he has been trapped here, deep below the Surface, since time immemorial. As the pair approach this haunting discovery, the hand holding Ganondorf’s body twitches, then falls limp. A stone, whose teardrop shape matches that of the secret stones of the Zonai, falls from the back of the hand and onto the cold ground. Zelda taps the stone, then picks it up, before it begins to glow with a bright light. But, before she can begin to study it… the unmistakable sound of a heartbeat echoes through the chamber. Horrified, the Princess can only watch as the body begins to twitch and convulse, cracking with the first movement after countless aeons of imprisonment. It almost rights itself, then drops back, its head hanging upside down… before it snaps towards the pair, and its eyes light up, burning with an insatiable, timeless hatred. Great tendrils of concentrated Gloom explode from Ganondorf’s chest, flooding the chamber and lunging directly at the Princess. But Link meets it with the Master Sword, jumping in front of Zelda and parrying back the evil. But this foe is beyond anything they have encountered before. The Gloom rushes forward once more, crawling down the Master Sword’s blade and onto Link’s arm, severely wounding him. It’s worth mentioning that this Link is already an accomplished Hero - here, he is at the peak of his power, after being trained and augmented by the Trials of the Ancient Sheikah during Breath of the Wild. During this opening segment, he has three full Stamina wheels and a total of 30 hearts… but not for long. The Gloom shatters Link’s strength, reducing his hearts back down to three - the same amount he had when he awoke from the Shrine of Resurrection, his body weak and his mind wiped. Not only this, the Gloom burns right through Link’s Champion’s Tunic and horrifically wounds his right arm, leaving it scarred and glowing with dark energy. Even the holy Master Sword - a weapon designed by the Goddess Hylia specifically to oppose evil - is not immune to it, and the blade is stained with Gloom. A final tendril rushes towards the pair, and Link once again tries to parry it… but this time, it’s too much. The Master Sword breaks - half of the blade splinters into tiny, sacred shards. One piece, however, flies towards Ganondorf - narrowly missing his neck and running across his cheek. It cuts into ancient flesh, and his blood begins to boil, but no more. The Blade of Evil’s Bane is broken, leaving only a single scratch on the Demon King. For the first time in millennia beyond counting, Ganondorf speaks. Somehow, Ganondorf knows both Link and Zelda by name. He claims that someone named Rauru had placed his faith in Link, and mocks him for his weakness. He arches back, and releases a final wave of Gloom - this time upwards, towards the cave’s ceiling. It pushes an ancient stone block, and the cave begins to collapse around them… and on the Surface, Hyrule Castle itself begins to rise into the air. Finally freed of his imprisonment, Ganondorf allows himself to fall into the endless blackness below. Exhausted, Link drops to one knee, and before Zelda can come to his aid… the floor beneath her gives way. Zelda drops into the same dark pit where Ganondorf had vanished, and Link, without a second thought for his injury, leaps after her. But he misses. Zelda falls, helpless… until a golden light envelops her, and she disappears. This is where the Princess and the Hero are separated, and the story of Tears of the Kingdom splits in two. Link is caught mid-air by the hand that had previously held Ganondorf, and pulled upwards into the light, where he eventually awakens on the Great Sky Island. Zelda, however, wakes up dazed and confused on what appears to be the Surface of Hyrule - though, it isn’t the Hyrule she knows. Instead, Zelda finds that she has somehow been transported to Hyrule’s distant past - to a time not long after the Kingdom’s founding. Here, ages removed from her own time, she uncovers the mysteries of the Ancient Zonai, and becomes the central part of this game’s cyclical narrative by setting up the events that will eventually occur for Link, who remains in the present day. Zelda is woken by two strange individuals: a couple who claim to be King Rauru and Queen Sonia, the first rulers of the Kingdom of Hyrule. Zelda is, of course, Hyrule’s Princess, the daughter of King Rhoam Bosphoramus Hyrule, which can mean only one thing: she has been transported to a time so far back in the past, it has become legend. King Rauru and Queen Sonia are the figures depicted on this mural: theirs was the union that the Kingdom of Hyrule was built upon. This means that Sonia is a Hyrulean woman, and Rauru is a Zonai. It’s worth noting that it doesn’t seem that this figure on the mural is Rauru specifically - we’re told later on that he is one of only two remaining Zonai, and it was his ancestors who had descended to the Surface, bringing seven secret stones with them, long long ago. So, even though Zelda has been transported to the distant past, it’s still a long time after the golden age of the Zonai: even this far back, their civilisation is ancient and shrouded in mystery. The only Zonai left are Rauru and his older sister, Mineru. They are tall, animal people, with incredibly long ears. It was said that Hylians had long, pointed ears so that they could hear the voices of the gods. Both of the Zonai are magical in different ways. Mineru can separate her spirit from her body, but Rauru has the power of Light: a sacred force that can repel and destroy evil. They both have a third eye on their foreheads, representing their enlightenment, that opens when they wield their magic powers. Sonia’s appearance closely resembles Zelda’s: in fact, she claims that she can sense a blood connection between Zelda and herself and King Rauru. She can also sense that Zelda possesses not only the power to control time, like Sonia herself, but also Rauru’s power of light. This means that Zelda is the distant descendant of this couple - the very first members of the Hyrulean Royal Family. We never see any of the couple’s children in-game, but the very fact that Zelda is descended from them, and what happens to them later on in the story, means that their children must already exist somewhere, and would go on to continue this bloodline through the ages, all the way up until the birth of this Princess Zelda. Zelda explains to the King and Queen that, in her time, something terrible is happening, but that she does not know how she got here, or how to get back to the future. Sonia advises her not to panic, to come back with them to the castle, where they can come up with a plan. Rauru suggests that Mineru, the only other remaining Zonai, may be able to help. At this point in history, the Great Plateau appears to have been the centre of the Kingdom of Hyrule. In Breath of the Wild, the Old Man describes this place as “the birthplace of the Kingdom of Hyrule”, and it seems that this is true for the Kingdom founded by Rauru and Sonia. A different Temple of Time, one built by the Zonai, is found in its place on the Plateau, and it seems that this era’s Hyrule Castle is found nearby, too. Breath of the Wild’s Hyrule Castle does not yet exist: Rauru and Sonia’s Castle is built here on the Great Plateau. In this time period, Hyrule appears largely uncharted, and untamed. Aside from the Great Plateau, the main island of civilisation, this Hyrule is even wilder than the one we know: central Hyrule is a forest, rather than a field. Death Mountain features a smoke ring, much like its appearance in Ocarina of Time, and the Duelling Peaks are, at this point, still one mountain. According to legend, the peaks were created when a dragon split a single mountain in two - a legend that seems to be true. Rauru’s Hyrule is defended with Shrines of Light - mystical stones that glow with spirals of green energy. In the early days of the Kingdom, Hyrule was plagued by monsters, which assaulted and terrorised its people. In response, Rauru and Sonia built Shrines to imprison the evil - each of them work somehow as holy seals to keep Hyrule safe. In this time period, Shrines of Light are found in different places to the ones Link will eventually encounter, thousands of years in the future, like the ones that defend the Great Plateau. Another purpose of the Shrines of Light is to illuminate the terrifying darkness below Hyrule: the Depths. Far below the surface lies a dark world, a warped reflection of the world above completely without light. That is, except for the Lightroots - treelike structures that are found directly below Shrines on the surface. The name of each Lightroot is just the name of the Shrine above it in reverse, and they are activated by Zonai magic. It’s likely that Rauru and Sonia created the Lightroots to illuminate the Depths. During this time, a chamberlain was appointed to record accounts of the lives of the King and Queen, to preserve their stories for discovery in the future. These give insight into the history and personality of the Royal couple. We learn that Sonia was once a priestess, born on the Surface. She is exceptionally intelligent, moreso than even King Rauru, who values her wisdom and insight on matters large and small. The King himself was jovial, with an easy laugh: he often set aside his Royal duties in favour of hunting, only returning to his responsibilities when sought out and scolded by Sonia. After her sudden appearance in this time, Zelda is welcomed into King Rauru’s Castle, and given new clothes by Queen Sonia. But she is still focused solely on finding a way to return to her own time, and so, Rauru accompanies her to meet his older sister, Mineru. Like Zelda, Mineru is a keen researcher. Her study is filled with books, and she’s said to become so engrossed in them that she forgets to eat. Mineru has a particular fascination with Zonai Constructs. They are described as vessels for the spirit when the body fails, so with her ability to separate her spirit from her body, she hopes that she can extend her life. She would eventually show Zelda her greatest work: a giant mecha. Rauru’s spirit later claims to have overseen the creation of Constructs: from Culinary Constructs to Soldiers. They are all powered by the same strands of green energy: perhaps they, too, are vessels for spirits in some way. The creation and maintenance of this technology required a lot of energy, which was mined in the Depths. Huge mines were found in all corners of the world, deep underneath every town. There, Constructs mined for Zonaite: a luminous mineral that can be processed into Charges. We’re only told that Zonaite contains a “mysterious energy” - but, considering that it is mostly found in the Depths, a realm of the dead, this energy could be connected to spirits, similar to Luminous Stones, said to contain the souls of the dead. Mineru shows a particular interest in Zelda’s Purah Pad. She notes that it definitely is not of her era - and asks to borrow it for a while, to attempt to restore its teleportation function, and to research the device further. She hands the device to a nearby Steward Construct, who shelves it away. Mineru, like Sonia and Rauru, possesses her own secret stone. Hers amplifies her power of spirit, Rauru’s stone strengthens his light powers, and Sonia’s her control over time. A secret stone can detect and react to an individual’s innate powers, and will change its appearance and colour to match. Once a stone is in somebody’s possession, it becomes engraved with a symbol that represents its power. These symbols are based on real-world Kanji, only stylised, and each featuring eye designs. Rauru’s stone is engraved with the symbol for Light, Mineru’s has the symbol for Spirit, and Sonia, the symbol for Time. But Zelda also possesses a stone engraved with the symbol for Time. Mineru\n",

      "Consolidated Context from ChromaDB: a tail. Perhaps they were a different type or class of Zonai, or an entirely different species who once lived in this subterranean world. Eventually, with Link’s help, Josha’s research progresses. She completes the ancient mural, depicting Rauru using a magical ability in an underground temple: what is now the Central Abandoned Mine: one of the facilities the Zonai had used to process Zonaite into energy. Curiously, all of the Zonai mines in the Depths are situated directly beneath the locations of towns on the Surface - and the Central Mine is no different. Although the Great Plateau is now in ruins, it was once the centre of Rauru’s Kingdom of Hyrule: it was where his Temple of Time and Hyrule Castle were found - as the Old Man states in Breath of the Wild, it was the birthplace of the Kingdom. But now that the Zonai are gone, their mines are empty: abandoned by all but Constructs and the spirits of the dead. But the Central Abandoned Mine isn’t Abandoned any more. During Breath of the Wild, Link was tasked with retrieving the Thunder Helm - a priceless artefact stolen from the Gerudo. It was stolen by the Yiga Clan: a militant group of Sheikah whose ancestry traces back to the split in the tribe, when an old King had outlawed their advanced technology. Relatively recently, these shunned Sheikah began to worship Ganon, lurking in an old Gerudo shrine north of the desert. They were led by Master Kohga: a bumbling, yet lovable idiot who, during his showdown with Link, ends up defeating himself: and falls down a seemingly bottomless pit. But this wasn’t the end of Kohga. This hole, it turns out, led to the Depths. The Yiga Master survived - and had discovered an entire new world. Over the next few years, the Yiga Clan had expanded into the Depths: they built strongholds and storerooms, and even began to experiment with ancient Zonai technology: building defence systems and vehicles with incredible names, like the Gloomdredger, or HOVERDOOM MK.3. Master Kohga commanded an almost godlike presence among the Yiga Clan. But he himself worshipped a greater evil: Ganondorf. The Yiga Clan had sworn allegiance to the Calamity Ganon over a century earlier, and now that the true threat had awoken, the fallen Sheikah once again gathered to support him: calling him the Magnificent One. Kohga and the Yiga live for vengeance: sworn to bring ruin upon Princess Zelda and her Kingdom, and of course, to kill their sworn enemy: Link. One focus of the Yiga Clan’s expeditions into the Depths was searching for a forgotten Zonai power. The Clan pored through musty old texts, and hunted through ancient Zonai ruins, all in search of the Autobuild power - the ability to instantly replicate Zonai vehicles, rather than painstakingly building them by hand. So, when Link just strolls into the Central Abandoned Mine and takes the power for himself, Kohga is understandably quite annoyed. Because Link now possesses King Rauru’s right arm, he’s able to open Zonai seals - something which is completely impossible for the Yiga, barring them from activating the Constructs and unlocking the Zonai’s secrets. Link encounters the Yiga Master multiple times throughout the Depths, at the Abandoned Mines underneath towns. At each of them, Kohga vows to destroy Link using increasingly ridiculous vehicles. But no matter what monstrosity he brings to bear against the Hero, it inevitably has the same result: leaving Kohga battered and bruised, and his inventions in broken pieces. Kohga eventually gives up on trying to steal the Autobuild power back from Link, and instead commits himself to Plan B. He claims that the Yiga have been gathering as much Zonai energy as they can, in the form of the crystallised charges Link can use to expand his own Zonai Energy Cells, in order to build a final weapon: an ultimate machine to offer to the Demon King, with which he will bring the world to its end. This weapon is a giant Construct - exactly like the one built by Mineru in the distant past as a vessel for her spirit. This had been her greatest achievement - a machine so large that Zelda once rode on its shoulders. Kohga’s Construct is, of course, decorated with Yiga symbols, and uses powers like force shields and spiked projectiles against Link. But even this isn’t enough - even the ultimate Yiga creation is bested by the Hero. Kohga has only one option left - a brand new technique he developed in the deepest darkness of the darkest Depths: the Kohga Rocket. But, just like he had done during his first showdown with Link during Breath of the Wild… Kohga’s ultimate technique ends up defeating himself. The Kohga Rocket instead hits its master, sending him careening through the Depths like a human firework, launching him up through a Chasm, where he vanishes: all the while screaming that he will have his revenge. Link’s quest through the Depths gives an insight into the mysteries of the ancient Zonai and their mining operations. But his main journey takes place in the world above, where he rallies Hyrule together against the evil that threatens it. Link soon discovers that there is a sinister truth behind the mystery of Zelda’s whereabouts. He and the search party weren’t the only ones to see a figure resembling the Princess since her disappearance: all across Hyrule there are reports of encounters with a woman who looks like Zelda, yet has cold, dead eyes like a doll. Ganondorf had fallen into the deepest reaches of the Depths after he awoke, but, just like he had in the distant past, he began to use his magic to manipulate the Kingdom, through a phantom saboteur. This puppet Zelda interfered with Hyrule’s reparations - causing distress and confusion at Stables, and even forbidding anyone, even the Zonai Survey Team, from inspecting the floating Ring Ruin in Kakariko Village. Though some noted the uncanny nature of this phantom, it was enough to fool the entire Kingdom, and disrupt it from within. At this point, even Link is unaware of the figure’s true identity and purpose. And this phantom was involved in the orchestration of existential threats in Hyrule’s four main regions. During the Upheaval, the Hebra region, home to the airborne Rito Tribe, became shrouded in an endless blizzard. The blistering cold means that travel to their Village is almost impossible, creating a food shortage. The Rito believe, quite sensibly, that the source of this blizzard must be the gigantic stormcloud directly above Hebra Peak, but it’s too turbulent for even the Rito to fly close. Only able to gaze up at the storm from below, the Rito are reminded of one of their oldest myths: the Stormwind Ark. The Ark has been part of Rito legend since before even the time of King Rauru. According to the story, the ancient Rito were once visited by a God, who fell from the heavens, unable to return. This “god” was one of the Zonai - who once lived in a civilisation above the clouds before settling on the surface. The Zonai stood atop a hill for days on end, longing to return to his home in the sky - but the Rito could not carry him there - they tried time after time, but none had wings strong enough to reach the islands in the heavens. The Zonai came up with a solution. The Rito gathered materials, and the Zonai used Ultrahand to piece them together - creating a fleet of small, flying ships. On this impossible armada, the Rito were able to climb into the heavens - above the clouds, to a world where floating islands dotted a clear blue sky. The Zonai was home - he rejoined his people far above the land, to where the Rito, reluctantly, returned. The Zonai sent a gift down to those who had helped him return home: the Stormwind Ark, a gigantic flying ship with many great oars, which move like wings and churn the air, creating strong winds for the Rito to glide on. Many years later, this ship was used as the Wind Temple - where the Ancient Sage of Wind met Princess Zelda and agreed to prepare his race to fight the Demon King in the future - and so, the Stormwind Ark was not only the source of the strong winds around Rito Village, but the place in which the Rito Sage’s secret stone was stored. The Ark eventually faded into legend, passed down in story and song for generations. Only Rito children still believe - adults know better, and dismiss any sightings of a gigantic flying galleon as mere hearsay. That was, until the Upheaval, when Ganondorf plagued the Rito with an eternal blizzard. They believe that something inside the storm is causing it - but none can fly high enough to investigate. Tulin, however, is an exception. He is the son of Teba, the Rito warrior who had helped Link reach the Divine Beast Vah Medoh during Breath of the Wild. In that game, Tulin was only a fledgling: but in the years since, has grown into an incredibly talented archer. His father has taken over the role of the village Chief from Kaneli, and is forced to devote much of his attention to matters closer to home. But Tulin is bold and confident: despite his father’s warnings, he desperately wants to help his people, and find a solution to the freezing blizzard that plagues them. Like Revali, the Champion of Vah Medoh, Tulin is able to control the wind around him - creating his own gusts of air on which to glide. Together with Link, he begins to climb the Rising Island Chain up into the blistering Hebra skies, and discovers the truth behind the legend of his people. As the pair climb, a voice sounds out from the clouds above: a calling from the Ancient Sage of Wind, who had promised Zelda in the distant past that their descendant would awaken to fight the Demon King. Tulin is this descendant: he is the warrior that his ancestor promised would rise to fight alongside Link. The pair leap across the sails of floating ships dancing in the snowy sky, until they reach the eye of the storm, and are faced with the source of the blizzard: the legendary Stormwind Ark. Link and Tulin witness the puppet of Zelda walking across the Ark’s deck, which contains a giant gate made from six segments. The Zelda clone vanishes, and a torrential gust of wind erupts from beneath the gate: whatever is causing the blizzard must be found below it - but five of the six segments remain shut. The pair explore the sky skip, using Tulin’s power of wind to activate five locks, which, in turn, unlocks the gate. They return to the deck, and Link activates the gate mechanism, releasing the source of the blizzard: Colgera. This frozen monstrosity is, in many ways, a successor to Molgera, the boss of the Wind Temple in The Wind Waker. Like its name suggests, though, Colgera is encased completely in ice, and can harness the wind and produce strong updrafts to keep itself aloft. It had been created by Ganondorf upon his resurrection, with the specific goal of harassing the Rito Tribe and preventing the awakening of their Sage, and the discovery of their secret stone. The beast is incredibly powerful, but so are Link and Tulin - together, the pair duel Colgera in the clouds - eventually destroying it, and restoring peace to the Hebra region. On the deck of the Stormwind Ark, which now floats in calm skies, they discover the Ancient Sage of Wind’s secret stone: which thaws out of a pillar of ice. Like it had been when the Sage had first received it from Rauru in the Forgotten Temple, the stone is white and smooth, a blank canvas yet to react to the abilities of an owner. The Sage of Wind’s spirit speaks to Link and Tulin - explaining the story of the Imprisoning War, and of his promise to Zelda. Tulin understands, and accepts his destiny: he inherits his ancestor’s secret stone, which reacts to his inner power and once again becomes a green stone of Wind. Immediately, Tulin reveals that he possesses a new power: he can create a spiritual avatar of himself. He holds Link’s hand, and transfers this power to Rauru’s arm: marked by a ring on Link’s little finger, swearing to fight alongside him against the darkness. Zelda’s Chosen Knight had defended the Rito from Ganondorf’s assault, and awakened the first of a new generation of Sages to confront him. But his journey was only just beginning: just like he had done years earlier, when he had rescued Hyrule from the clutches of the Calamity, he sets his sights on the three remaining regions. Death Mountain, the home of the Gorons, cools significantly: the lava that had streamed down its rocky slopes dries up, and the volcano’s peak is cloaked in an ominous cloud of Gloom. And the Gorons themselves suffered a terrible fate. During Breath of the Wild, Link had travelled alongside Yunobo, the grandson of the Champion Daruk, to Divine Beast Vah Rudania - whose rampaging was causing violent eruptions, making mining the mountain difficult. Some time after Link calmed the beast, the mountain fell dormant: opening up access to new caves and ore deposits on its rocky slopes. Yunobo founded YunoboCo: a mining company - which became successful enough to effectively run Goron City. After the Upheaval, however, Yunobo began receiving instructions from Ganondorf’s puppet: it gave him a new mask, which seized control of his mind, completely changing his personality. Gorons usually dine on a diet of rocks directly from the mountain, like the classic Rock Roast, but YunoboCo began to mine for Marbled Rock Roast: which glows red with Gloom. Gorons who consume Marbled Rock Roast are literally stoned, they are lulled into a trancelike state, and their eyes glow an eerie purple. So, by the time Link arrives on Death Mountain, most of the Gorons have been enslaved to this new food - they refuse to talk, work, or do anything other than sit and gorge themselves on the rock. Only the very young and very old are unaffected: they’re unable to digest the new rock, but are too weak, or too afraid, to stop Yunobo’s operation. Only Link is brave enough to confront him. He still recognises the Hero from their previous adventure, but the puppet of Zelda uses the mask to force him into a frenzy. Once the mask is broken, however, Yunobo returns to his former self: everything that has happened since he put it on is only remembered as a blur. The Goron is shocked to see the red haze of Gloom surrounding Death Mountain’s peak: but the children aren’t. They remember this happening during the Upheaval: as soon as the castle rose into the air, the red mist began to choke the mountaintop. Yunobo had apparently gone to investigate: but when he returned, was wearing the mysterious mask, warning everyone to stay clear of the peak. The Goron and the Hylian embark on another journey together: to the summit of Death Mountain. Here, puppet Zelda unleashes Moragia: a titanic beast of living rock, rising from the summit of the volcano. Moragia’s name is similar to Volvagia, the dragon boss of the Fire Temple in Ocarina of Time, and sure enough, it takes the form of three dragon-like heads of stone. According to its Hyrule Compendium entry, its body is composed of boiling lava and hard rocks infused with Gloom, which it holds together by drawing both heat and Gloom power from the crater. By riding a Zonai plane that had fallen from the skies and conveniently landed on the mountain during the Upheaval, Link and Yunobo destroy the three heads of Moragia, opening up the mountain’s crater to reveal a gigantic chasm, a portal to the Depths below the region. Like Tulin, Yunobo is the distant descendant of an Ancient Sage - who calls out from the Fire Temple in the deep. Like the Stormwind Ark, the Temple used by the Ancient Goron Sage is a sign of a close bond between his race and the Zonai: the forgotten city of Gorondia. This towering structure built with Zonai stonework was once the home of the Gorons in the distant past, but was abandoned and lost in myth. Legends tell of its advanced technology and strange vehicles, but none alive had seen it until Yunobo and Link enter, in pursuit of the puppet. Here they fight Marbled Gohma: the source of the Marbled Rock Roast, a fiery member of the Gohma family, quite similar to the Wind Waker’s first boss. Yunobo’s power can shatter its legs, leaving its vulnerable eye exposed to Link’s blades - the pair destroy the monster, and Yunobo is awakened as the Sage of Fire. Zora’s Domain is plagued by the Sky Islands directly above it - the reappearance of the Water Temple, which was once the source of their pure water. However, Ganondorf’s power has caused a toxic sludge to pour from these islands, sullying the Domain’s waters and injuring any Zora who comes into contact with it. At one point, the doppelganger of Zelda attacked the Zora King Dorephan - unleashing a sludge monster in an attempt on his life. Dorephan had previously defended his domain from a Guardian, so he of course was able to defeat the foe, but not before taking considerable damage from the toxic substance. He retreats to his secret spring, so that word does not spread of the fact that he was attacked by Hyrule’s Princess and cause panic. Dorephan’s son, Prince Sidon, is incredibly gifted with the ability to control water. This is something that all Zora are able to do, to a certain extent, but Sidon’s powers exceed all others. He is forced to almost single handedly bear the brunt of the poisonous sludge raining from the Water Temple - purifying it as quickly as he can to prevent it reaching the Domain just below. At some point between Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, Sidon married Yona: a Zora who is, apparently, native to an entirely different domain somewhere in the world. This means that there are more Zora found outside of Hyrule - this world is bigger than just this single country. Sidon holds back the sludge atop Ploymus Mountain, where Link fought a Lynel in Breath of the Wild. Since then, it has been repurposed - a shrine has been constructed to honour Sidon’s older sister, known as Mipha Court. The statue of the Princess has been moved from the domain to here, replaced with one immortalising Sidon and Link’s victory over the Divine Beast Vah Ruta. Prince Sidon is the descendant of the Ancient Zora Sage, and so he pieces together the mystery of the sky islands above his home with Link, eventually uncovering the Ancient Zora Waterworks, and opening a waterfall that allows access to Wellspring Island, and the Water Temple itself. Again, this Temple is the original source of Zora’s Domain’s pure waters - a small group of floating platforms below five giant faucets. Since the Upheaval and the reemergence of the Temple from the skies, it has become the home of Mucktorok, a creation of Ganondorf and the creator of the toxic sludge: a creature related to the smaller Octoroks. Together, Link and Sidon destroy the creature, stopping the endless flow of poison. Sidon not only becomes the Sage of Water, but also Zora’s Domain’s King: his father, concerned that he allowed himself to be hurt by a monster, believes it is time for him to pass the torch to his son. King Sidon is crowned, alongside his wife: Queen Yona. The air in the Gerudo Desert is choked by a sandstorm, and the ground itself gives way to quicksand and sinkholes. Worse still, the dead stalk the dunes: Gibdos, horrifying creatures somewhere between zombies and insects, force the Gerudo underground, where they shelter in an ancient bunker below the Throne Room. The source of the sandstorm and the Gibdos that hide in it is Queen Gibdo - a giant insect that whips the sand up into a storm with its wings. Together with Riju, the chief of the Gerudo, the same vai who Link had subdued Vah Naboris with during Breath of the Wild, Link uncovers the secret of the Lightning Temple from an ancient tablet beneath Gerudo Town, and the dungeon rises from the sands. It is a gigantic pyramid, built by the Zonai and the Gerudo in the distant past. Aside from being the elemental Temple of the Ancient Sage of Lightning, we don’t know anything about this place and what it was used for for certain. Great statues of heroines stare down from the top, and tombs full of Gibdos lurk in the shadows. By defeating Queen Gohma in the highest room in the Temple, Link and Riju uncover the fourth secret stone, and the Gerudo Chief swears to offer her support to Link as the new Sage of Lightning - vowing to use her powerful control of electricity against the Demon King. I mentioned in part 1 that the Ancient Sages all wear masks resembling the heads of the four Sheikah Divine Beasts, but their Temples strengthen this connection. Each Temple features an animal motif that matches the Divine Beasts: the Stormwind Ark of course features bird designs, the Fire Temple’s boss chamber includes designs resembling Vah Rudania’s head, the Water Temple’s faucets are shaped like elephants, and the Lightning Temple features camel designs, as well as the six eyes of Vah Naboris. Much of the story of these Ancient Sages is still a mystery, but it seems that they were the inspiration for the Divine Beasts. After awakening the Sages, Link returns to Lookout Landing, where Purah stands looking through the telescope at the castle. By rescuing the four regions from Ganondorf’s creations, Link has started to rally the Kingdom, to gather and mobilise its forces against the Demon King. Members from each race can now be found at Lookout Landing, diligently preparing for the battle ahead. Purah looks through her telescope at the castle… and spots Princess Zelda, standing amidst a burning red sky. The plan changes: Link must now reach the floating citadel, and uncover the truth of this Zelda clone. Finally, just as it had been during Breath of the Wild, Hyrule Castle was Link’s target. He had previously learned from Zelda’s diary, found in the house in Hateno Village, that she had arranged for a new and improved Champion’s Tunic to be crafted for him - and hid it in a secret compartment in the castle’s throne room. This is a little strange, as we saw Link wearing these new, improved Champion’s Leathers at the very beginning of the game, where they were burned by Ganondorf’s Gloom, but regardless - he lights two fires to unlock the chest, once again donning his iconic blue. In the ancient halls of the seat of the Royal Family, the fortress he had once stormed to purge Calamity Ganon from the land, Link finally corners the doppelganger. She uses her magic to create an illusion, to temporarily restore the Castle’s Sanctum to its former glory - fitting, for the last thing Link will ever see. Above Zelda, a spectral image appears - the unmistakable form of Ganondorf, withered after his long imprisonment. The Demon King taunts, and then reveals the truth. Zelda falls limp, hanging like a puppet on strings, then dissolves into Gloom: which gathers, and collects into the dark shape of Phantom Ganon, the Demon King’s secret saboteur. Phantom Ganon has appeared numerous times before in the series: a ghost created by Ganondorf to do\n",

      "Consolidated Context from ChromaDB: explains that, just like Sonia said, Zelda possesses the power to control both Light and Time, but the Zonai notes that the secret stone she carries seems to amplify her Time power specifically. So, it appears that a secret stone will only strengthen one particular aspect of an individual’s powers, even when that individual holds multiple different abilities. Zelda came into possession of this stone when it fell from the hand imprisoning Ganondorf. At first, this stone was white in colour, but once Zelda touched it, it reacted to the powers within her, and became a yellow Time stone. This, Mineru explains, is how Zelda ended up in the distant past in the first place. Secret stones don’t create new abilities or grant their wielders new magic, they simply amplify the powers that are already found within someone. When she fell into the crevice deep below Hyrule Castle, it was her own innate power to control time that transported her to the past, only amplified by the possession of a secret stone. This means that there isn’t an easy way to return to the present day - if Zelda doesn’t know how she was able to manipulate time in the first place, she won’t be able to reverse it. Except… for one, sinister possibility. Mineru also explains that there are stories about a forbidden act called “draconification”. That “to swallow a secret stone is to become an immortal dragon… one blessed with eternal life.” But that “to become an immortal dragon is to lose oneself.“ This would provide a way for Zelda to return to her own time, but it would mean sacrificing everything: losing what makes her her. Instead, Rauru decides that Zelda should spend some time with Sonia, who also has the ability to control time, and a Time secret stone that matches Zelda’s. Together, Rauru hopes they will be able to study and understand Zelda’s powers more, and, perhaps, find a way to send her home. Rauru’s young Kingdom was strong. But not without its own troubles. In the desert to the southwest, a dark storm was gathering - Hyrule was watched by envious eyes. The Gerudo are a race of tall, powerful warriors, as tough and as dangerous as the desert they call home. The Gerudo are notable for being almost entirely female: only one male is born every century, a man destined to become their King. In the time of King Rauru, the Gerudo leader was called Ganondorf, a man of great power… and great ambition. Ganondorf was known to be a warrior of unmatched strength, a master of all weapons who could move his hulking mass with impossible speed. But he was also an incredible sorcerer, and was able to control darkness in the form of Gloom. From the desert, Ganondorf watched the young Kingdom, and plotted its downfall. Hyrule would bow before him - this land would be his to shape as he saw fit. At first, Ganondorf kept his true ambitions secret, but he was known to be dangerous - he repeatedly ignored invitations from King Rauru to swear fealty. The Gerudo King’s first move against Hyrule occurred during the time Princess Zelda was sent back to - an initial assault to test the Kingdom’s military strength. Ganondorf and a small force of Gerudo warriors loyal to him stand at a high vantage point, and unleash the raw power of the desert against Hyrule. One Gerudo woman plays an ornate flute, and the eerie music calls forth a swarm of Molduga - giant monsters who swim in the desert’s sand. Each of them is a powerful threat in its own right, but this many, together, is unprecedented. Guards stationed on the Great Plateau’s walls spot the oncoming horde, and sound the alarm. Before long, King Rauru himself appears, with Queen Sonia and Zelda just behind. Though this is an era without an incarnation of Link, this Hyrule is anything but defenceless. Without a word, Rauru brings his hands together in front of his face. His secret stone, which amplifies his innate power to use light to dispel evil, starts to glow. Behind him, Sonia raises her right arm, and beckons for Zelda to do the same. The pair’s identical secret stones start to glow, as they add their power to Rauru’s. Notably, Zelda’s power glows with a much larger, brighter light than Sonia’s - perhaps indicating that, even without training, she possesses a much greater power. Rauru keeps his eyes on the approaching horde, and focuses the energy between his hands. Suddenly, the third eye on his forehead opens, and his power explodes outwards: When the beam subsides, the remains of Ganondorf’s first invasion lies dying in the sand. Disappointed by this outcome, the Gerudo King realises that brute force will not be enough. Rauru, augmented by his secret stone, is too powerful - his ability to repel evil is too great a defence. But the King of Hyrule had literally shown his hand - even from a great distance, Ganondorf spots the secret stone shining on Rauru’s wrist. These Zonai artefacts are the key to Hyrule’s strength… but could also be used against the Kingdom. If Ganondorf could not break Hyrule by force, he would instead try deception: to lull Rauru and his Kingdom into a false peace. Some time after the Molduga assault, Ganondorf, accompanied by his retinue of Gerudo warriors, travelled to Hyrule Castle to swear fealty. In the Throne Room, they are received by King Rauru, Queen Sonia, and Zelda. The two Gerudo women directly behind Ganondorf stand out for wearing gold masks. These two are presumably among his highest-ranking servants - they also flanked him during the Molduga attack. On the left shoulder is Hylian lettering, which translates to “KOUME” and “KOTAKE” - identifying this pair as the witches seen during Ocarina of Time and the Oracle games. In Ocarina of Time, these witches, who eventually combine to form Twinrova, are said to be the 400-year old surrogate mothers of Ganondorf. They look considerably younger here, so they might not have raised this Ganondorf, but it’s clear that they are still important to him: their names can also be found marked on the Gloom set of weapons used by Ganondorf himself. Ganondorf and his Gerudo kneel before the Throne, pledging his service to Rauru in return for acceptance into his Kingdom. The King accepts, commending Ganondorf on his status and welcoming him into his realm. But even as Rauru speaks, Ganondorf’s focus was instead on the secret stones - ancient talismans of unimaginable power, hanging from the necks of Zelda and Sonia, and from Rauru’s wrist. For his first action as an official part of the Kingdom of Hyrule, Ganondorf chooses to honour the King with thinly veiled insults and threats in his own throne room. Mockingly, he muses that when Rauru’s ancestors first descended upon these lands long ago, they must have seemed to be gods. He points out how, by taking a Hyrulean woman as his wife and now ruling this land as its King, Rauru has risen above his admirable lineage. The Gerudo King values power and power alone - and the Kingdom of Hyrule protects the weak and defends the innocent. In the time before the Kingdom’s Founding, the world had been a place of chaos, a brutal land where only the strongest thrived, a time that Ganondorf believed had more vigour and fighting spirit. Ganondorf rejects the idea that one of the godlike Zonai should dare to control this land: he despises the peace that Rauru and Sonia have ensured. But the Zonai are gone: their time is over, and they no longer grace this world with their presence. Except for Rauru and Mineru. Rauru defends himself: he claims that even if something happens to him, his Kingdom will endure for generations to come. This could be another indication that Rauru and Sonia do indeed have children: who will inherit the throne and uphold Rauru’s peace even after his death. One King dismisses the other, and Ganondorf climbs to his feet and turns to leave, signalling his retinue to do the same. Zelda, who had watched the exchange from Rauru’s side, is concerned about trusting Ganondorf. She believes that his heart holds dark ambitions, and notes that even his name gives her pause. The name “Ganondorf” should probably do more than just give her pause, considering she had previously kept a dark being named “Ganon” imprisoned for a hundred years, but nevertheless, Rauru explains that he is well aware of the Gerudo King’s evil nature. He claims that he wants to keep Ganondorf close, where he can keep an eye on him, and assures the Princess that she need not worry. This entire throne room scene is incredibly reminiscent of a scene from Ocarina of Time - where Link first finds Zelda in her courtyard, peering in through one of the castle’s windows. In both games, Ganondorf travels to the castle to swear fealty to the King on his knees, though, secretly plots to overthrow him. In both games, Zelda warns the King about Ganondorf’s intentions, and the King ignores her… a decision that would lead to tragedy. The chamberlain’s stone tablets describe an unsettling development in this time period. There are whispers of a strange lady who walks around the castle at night - a woman who appears identical to Princess Zelda in all ways but one: her eyes are lifeless and dead. When asked, Zelda herself remembers nothing of these walks: something, or someone, stalks Rauru’s Castle in the black of night, wearing Zelda’s face like a mask. Some time later, Zelda sits under a gazebo with Rauru and Sonia, attended to by Constructs and protected by a handful of Royal Guards. The Princess reaches out her hand, and accidentally knocks a bowl off of the table. It falls towards the stone floor… then stops, and retraces its path back onto the table. This is a display of Sonia’s time power, strengthened by her secret stone. The Queen explains that it’s like drawing out an object’s memory, coaxing it back towards a certain moment in time. Zelda is, as yet, unable to properly control the time powers she inherited through Sonia’s bloodline, and so, she remains trapped in this time period. The three discuss Zelda’s predicament: she wants desperately to return home, but also to lend her support to this time, where a conflict with the Gerudo King seems likely. But Sonia is exceptionally perceptive, and knows there is another reason Zelda needs to return home: Link. At the mere mention of his name, Zelda smiles, and describes the Hero to Rauru: he is a Royal Knight, one originally appointed to be her protector. He is dedicated, and refuses to back down from any challenge. He is very strong, and his heart is good and true. Zelda’s feelings towards Link were a central part of her character in Breath of the Wild - eventually, it was her love for him that awakened her sealing powers and prevented the total collapse of her Kingdom. And even now, while trapped in a different age, Zelda has complete faith in her Knight. One night, Princess Zelda requests a private audience with Queen Sonia. In the quiet courtyard outside the castle, the pair meet: no guards, no Rauru, just Sonia and Zelda. Except… it’s not Zelda at all: it’s the mysterious doppelganger, who wastes no time drawing a Gerudo knife and hurling it towards the Queen. But the blade stops dead, inches from the back of Sonia’s head - frozen in time. Sonia turns and faces the doppelganger: she always knew the true purpose of this meeting, and the true identity of this mysterious clone. This is not Zelda, it is a puppet of Ganondorf - an illusion summoned with his dark magic. From behind a stone pillar, the real Zelda steps out: her right hand outstretched, engulfed in a golden light. She had been the one to freeze the dagger in time - her training with Sonia has allowed her to refine and better control her abilities. With a click of her fingers, Zelda sends the blade spinning back towards the phantom, where it drops, harmlessly, at its feet. With a haunting laugh, the doppelganger vanishes into dark magic. But Ganondorf was one step ahead. The Gerudo King emerges from the shadows, and hits Sonia in the back with such force that it kills her almost instantly. Before her body even hits the floor, Ganondorf reaches out and rips the secret stone from her neck. Zelda weeps over Sonia’s lifeless body, but Ganondorf simply laughs: a wild, vicious laugh that echoes across the Plateau. A sick smile on his face, Ganondorf turns and walks away. Sonia’s secret stone glows gold in his hand, still marked with the Time symbol that reflects the Queen’s inner power. But it was her stone no longer. Ganondorf holds the stone in front of him, and it changes to reflect his own magic. The stone grows in size, before a new symbol is engraved on its surface: a symbol that represents Darkness. Again, secret stones do not grant their wielders new powers, only amplify whatever powers they already have. Ganondorf was, of course, an exceptionally powerful magic user, with the ability to control and manipulate dark, evil forces. Now that it is changed to reflect these abilities, Ganondorf’s secret stone boosts his power significantly. Zelda can only watch in terror as the skies turn a burning red, and Ganondorf is engulfed in an aura of Gloom. His secret stone glows, and he screams - …and Ganondorf, the Gerudo King, is gone. The Demon King stands before Zelda, a colossal blood moon eclipsing the sky behind him. But he wasn’t finished yet. He raises his hand, and a beam of dark energy launches upwards, striking the clouds and exploding into smaller missiles of Gloom, which rain down on Rauru’s Kingdom - each of them congealing into a beast under Ganondorf’s control. Rauru steps out into the courtyard - too late. He sees Zelda holding Sonia’s body, and cries out. As he mourns his dead wife, Ganondorf mocks him: claiming that he took the godlike power of the secret stones for granted, and that his Queen was merely the first victim of Rauru’s arrogance. He spits that Rauru tried to control him, and that he will die knowing that he failed. This is Ganondorf’s jealousy and pride showing: he hated the power that Rauru held over him, power that he coveted. Furious, Rauru runs towards the Demon King, but is stopped by Zelda - who knows that, despite the King of Light’s sacred powers, fighting against Ganondorf would mean certain death. The Demon King raises his hand, and sends forth a torrent of Gloom towards Rauru, who uses his power to shield both himself and Zelda. Without delay, the Princess picks up her Purah Pad, and uses it to teleport herself and Rauru, as well as Sonia’s body, to safety, thanks to Mineru’s work on enabling the transportation feature in this time. They had escaped, for now, but there was no time for relief. Queen Sonia was dead, and Ganondorf possessed the power of a God. The Menace was unleashed. With a secret stone amplifying his powers, there is nothing left that could stand in the Demon King’s way. Under the bleeding moon, legions of monsters are born into the world: given a single instruction: to sweep over Hyrule, to eliminate this Kingdom and its allies. The conflict that would become known as The Imprisoning War had begun. With the Demon King unleashed, the Hylians weren’t the only ones in danger. Just like during the present day, Rauru’s Hyrule was also home to the winged Rito, the aquatic Zora, and the mighty Gorons of Death Mountain: all of whom were threatened by Ganondorf and his armies. Even the Gerudo, Ganondorf’s own people, were not safe: those that refused to join him were destroyed, and, before long, the last free village in the Gerudo Desert fell under his control. In the Forgotten Temple, in the northwest of the Kingdom, Rauru calls for a summit to discuss the war against the Demon King. The leaders of the Gerudo, Goron, Zora and Rito Tribes gather, along with King Rauru, his sister, Mineru, and Zelda herself. Rauru unlocks the door at the back of the Temple, where he reveals his secret weapons: four additional Zonai secret stones. Zelda, Mineru and Rauru himself of course already possess stones, so these four are bestowed upon the leaders of the Tribes. At first, each stone is gigantic, its surface a plain and unmarked white colour. But, once in the possession of new wielders, the stones change to represent their powers, just like Zelda’s and Ganondorf’s had done. The stones transform to reflect the power of Water for the Zora, Wind for the Rito, Fire for the Goron and Lightning for the Gerudo, boosting each leader’s abilities to new heights. We are never told the names of these four Sages, or learn anything about their history. However, they each wear a mask shaped like an animal: an elephant for the Zora, a bird for the Rito, a salamander for the Goron and a camel for the Gerudo. These match the designs of the four Divine Beasts, the colossal war engines built by the Sheikah to defend Hyrule against the Calamity that occurred 10,000 years before Breath of the Wild. Rauru’s Hyrule, and these four Sages, predate the Divine Beasts: it seems likely that the Sheikah chose designs to honour these Ancient Sages, who had fought alongside the King in the earliest recorded conflict with the Demon King. Now each possessing a secret stone, this group of six individuals swear to serve Rauru, the seventh, and are each granted the title of Sage. This group, the Seven Sages, represents the seven most powerful individuals in Hyrule at the time, save for the Demon King himself. If there was any force that could stop him, this was it. On the evening before the Sages planned to confront the Demon King, Zelda and Rauru speak in private. The Princess reveals the truth of the events that had led to her ending up in the past: she had found a man underground. Now that she has seen Ganondorf transformed by the power of the secret stone, she realises: the man underground was Ganondorf, who had lived on through the ages all the way up until the present day. She believes that the battle tomorrow will not end in victory: she has seen its outcome, and knows that they will fail to stop the Demon King. Rauru admits that Zelda may be right, but that it is his duty as King to try and protect his people. He blames himself for Ganondorf’s ascension: like he had told Zelda in the throne room, he had known of the Gerudo King’s evil nature for a long time, but failed to stop him. Rauru says that if they should fail tomorrow, then their last line of defence will be Link - Zelda’s Knight, who carries the legendary blade of evil’s bane, who will meet Ganondorf in the far future. He believes that the future Zelda knows was one where she had never appeared in the past, and that there is a reason that Zelda was sent back to this time. The following day, the alliance tracks Ganondorf down to the Depths in the north of Central Hyrule, and in an underground chamber, they face the Demon King. They outnumber Ganondorf seven to one: seven secret stones against Ganondorf’s own. All reason suggests that they should be victorious… But Ganondorf’s power was beyond anything they could have imagined. The Demon King breaks each and every Sage. His Gloom, just like it had done in Zelda’s own time, decays their weapons in their hands, and burns their bodies with dark magic. Zelda’s fears had come true: despite their power, Rauru’s alliance had failed to stop Ganondorf. Rauru, seeing no other option, commits himself to one, final act for his Kingdom. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and begins to focus his power. Seeing this, the Sages launch another attack: they hurl their weapons towards the Demon King, who dodges and parries each of them with ease. Zelda, weak and injured, holds out both hands and uses her time powers to recall the weapons back towards Ganondorf - but he’d seen this power before, through the eyes of his phantom Zelda. He turns back towards Rauru, ready to end the fight… but Rauru isn’t there. The King of Light uses the same trick Ganondorf had used to kill Sonia - Zelda’s Recall attack was a distraction, allowing him to move behind the King unseen. Time seems to slow as Rauru closes the distance, his right arm glowing with his power of Light, strengthened by his secret stone. With sacred force, he strikes the Demon King in the centre of his chest, forming the seal that would bind him for millennia. Ganondorf knows exactly what Rauru has done, and what it will mean. He laughs, saying that thousands of years will pass in the blink of an eye: the seal only delays the Demon King’s inevitable return. But Rauru answers with hope: because of Zelda, he knows that when the seal breaks, a swordsman who wields the Master Sword will face him. Ganondorf spits his final words in this time: he says Link’s name, and that he looks forward to their meeting. Rauru and Ganondorf freeze in place. The light fades from their eyes, and the maelstrom of sacred energy erupting from the King of Light slows into a glacial coil. It seems that Rauru’s seal on Ganondorf works in a similar way to the Shrines of Light: structures built by Sonia and himself to seal away monsters that had threatened his Kingdom. The foundation of this seal is Rauru’s power of Light, a direct counter to Ganondorf’s own dark magic. The Imprisoning War is over: the King of Darkness is sealed, and the King of Light with him. The pair would remain here, petrified, for thousands upon thousands of years, in what became known as the Imprisoning Chamber. To ensure that the King’s magic held, the Hylians constructed a new castle directly on top of this sacred site. This was built to be the new seat of the Royal Family, Rauru’s descendants, but more importantly it was a fortress, designed to protect the seal from disturbance. The Castle became the literal heart of the Kingdom - not only located in the very centre of Hyrule, but critical to its survival. Rauru’s strength contained the Demon King’s powers. But not entirely. As strong as this seal was, Ganondorf was stronger: his hatred seeped out from his chest in thick, red fog. Deep below Hyrule’s surface, the sheer force of his rage boiled like the heart of a volcano for millennia: until it erupted into the Calamity Ganon, emerging from directly below the Castle. This monstrosity was defeated, however, by a Princess of Hyrule and a warrior wielding the soul of a hero. But not forever. Rauru’s seal imprisoned Ganondorf himself, but he had unknowingly trapped Hyrule into a terrible cycle. Every 10,000 years, the Demon King’s hatred would manifest as a Calamity, claw its way out from below Hyrule Castle, and try to burn the Kingdom to the ground. The Calamity was formed from Malice, which differed from Gloom. Gloom appears to be the direct, dark magic of Ganondorf himself, while Malice seems to be a physical manifestation of his unstoppable rage. This happened time and time again, right up to the Ancient Calamity, 10,000 years before Breath of the Wild, the foe defeated with the help of the Divine Beasts. Interestingly, this Calamity appears to have been repelled not by a Hylian Link, but a Hero from\n",

      "Consolidated Context from ChromaDB: a tail. Perhaps they were a different type or class of Zonai, or an entirely different species who once lived in this subterranean world. Eventually, with Link’s help, Josha’s research progresses. She completes the ancient mural, depicting Rauru using a magical ability in an underground temple: what is now the Central Abandoned Mine: one of the facilities the Zonai had used to process Zonaite into energy. Curiously, all of the Zonai mines in the Depths are situated directly beneath the locations of towns on the Surface - and the Central Mine is no different. Although the Great Plateau is now in ruins, it was once the centre of Rauru’s Kingdom of Hyrule: it was where his Temple of Time and Hyrule Castle were found - as the Old Man states in Breath of the Wild, it was the birthplace of the Kingdom. But now that the Zonai are gone, their mines are empty: abandoned by all but Constructs and the spirits of the dead. But the Central Abandoned Mine isn’t Abandoned any more. During Breath of the Wild, Link was tasked with retrieving the Thunder Helm - a priceless artefact stolen from the Gerudo. It was stolen by the Yiga Clan: a militant group of Sheikah whose ancestry traces back to the split in the tribe, when an old King had outlawed their advanced technology. Relatively recently, these shunned Sheikah began to worship Ganon, lurking in an old Gerudo shrine north of the desert. They were led by Master Kohga: a bumbling, yet lovable idiot who, during his showdown with Link, ends up defeating himself: and falls down a seemingly bottomless pit. But this wasn’t the end of Kohga. This hole, it turns out, led to the Depths. The Yiga Master survived - and had discovered an entire new world. Over the next few years, the Yiga Clan had expanded into the Depths: they built strongholds and storerooms, and even began to experiment with ancient Zonai technology: building defence systems and vehicles with incredible names, like the Gloomdredger, or HOVERDOOM MK.3. Master Kohga commanded an almost godlike presence among the Yiga Clan. But he himself worshipped a greater evil: Ganondorf. The Yiga Clan had sworn allegiance to the Calamity Ganon over a century earlier, and now that the true threat had awoken, the fallen Sheikah once again gathered to support him: calling him the Magnificent One. Kohga and the Yiga live for vengeance: sworn to bring ruin upon Princess Zelda and her Kingdom, and of course, to kill their sworn enemy: Link. One focus of the Yiga Clan’s expeditions into the Depths was searching for a forgotten Zonai power. The Clan pored through musty old texts, and hunted through ancient Zonai ruins, all in search of the Autobuild power - the ability to instantly replicate Zonai vehicles, rather than painstakingly building them by hand. So, when Link just strolls into the Central Abandoned Mine and takes the power for himself, Kohga is understandably quite annoyed. Because Link now possesses King Rauru’s right arm, he’s able to open Zonai seals - something which is completely impossible for the Yiga, barring them from activating the Constructs and unlocking the Zonai’s secrets. Link encounters the Yiga Master multiple times throughout the Depths, at the Abandoned Mines underneath towns. At each of them, Kohga vows to destroy Link using increasingly ridiculous vehicles. But no matter what monstrosity he brings to bear against the Hero, it inevitably has the same result: leaving Kohga battered and bruised, and his inventions in broken pieces. Kohga eventually gives up on trying to steal the Autobuild power back from Link, and instead commits himself to Plan B. He claims that the Yiga have been gathering as much Zonai energy as they can, in the form of the crystallised charges Link can use to expand his own Zonai Energy Cells, in order to build a final weapon: an ultimate machine to offer to the Demon King, with which he will bring the world to its end. This weapon is a giant Construct - exactly like the one built by Mineru in the distant past as a vessel for her spirit. This had been her greatest achievement - a machine so large that Zelda once rode on its shoulders. Kohga’s Construct is, of course, decorated with Yiga symbols, and uses powers like force shields and spiked projectiles against Link. But even this isn’t enough - even the ultimate Yiga creation is bested by the Hero. Kohga has only one option left - a brand new technique he developed in the deepest darkness of the darkest Depths: the Kohga Rocket. But, just like he had done during his first showdown with Link during Breath of the Wild… Kohga’s ultimate technique ends up defeating himself. The Kohga Rocket instead hits its master, sending him careening through the Depths like a human firework, launching him up through a Chasm, where he vanishes: all the while screaming that he will have his revenge. Link’s quest through the Depths gives an insight into the mysteries of the ancient Zonai and their mining operations. But his main journey takes place in the world above, where he rallies Hyrule together against the evil that threatens it. Link soon discovers that there is a sinister truth behind the mystery of Zelda’s whereabouts. He and the search party weren’t the only ones to see a figure resembling the Princess since her disappearance: all across Hyrule there are reports of encounters with a woman who looks like Zelda, yet has cold, dead eyes like a doll. Ganondorf had fallen into the deepest reaches of the Depths after he awoke, but, just like he had in the distant past, he began to use his magic to manipulate the Kingdom, through a phantom saboteur. This puppet Zelda interfered with Hyrule’s reparations - causing distress and confusion at Stables, and even forbidding anyone, even the Zonai Survey Team, from inspecting the floating Ring Ruin in Kakariko Village. Though some noted the uncanny nature of this phantom, it was enough to fool the entire Kingdom, and disrupt it from within. At this point, even Link is unaware of the figure’s true identity and purpose. And this phantom was involved in the orchestration of existential threats in Hyrule’s four main regions. During the Upheaval, the Hebra region, home to the airborne Rito Tribe, became shrouded in an endless blizzard. The blistering cold means that travel to their Village is almost impossible, creating a food shortage. The Rito believe, quite sensibly, that the source of this blizzard must be the gigantic stormcloud directly above Hebra Peak, but it’s too turbulent for even the Rito to fly close. Only able to gaze up at the storm from below, the Rito are reminded of one of their oldest myths: the Stormwind Ark. The Ark has been part of Rito legend since before even the time of King Rauru. According to the story, the ancient Rito were once visited by a God, who fell from the heavens, unable to return. This “god” was one of the Zonai - who once lived in a civilisation above the clouds before settling on the surface. The Zonai stood atop a hill for days on end, longing to return to his home in the sky - but the Rito could not carry him there - they tried time after time, but none had wings strong enough to reach the islands in the heavens. The Zonai came up with a solution. The Rito gathered materials, and the Zonai used Ultrahand to piece them together - creating a fleet of small, flying ships. On this impossible armada, the Rito were able to climb into the heavens - above the clouds, to a world where floating islands dotted a clear blue sky. The Zonai was home - he rejoined his people far above the land, to where the Rito, reluctantly, returned. The Zonai sent a gift down to those who had helped him return home: the Stormwind Ark, a gigantic flying ship with many great oars, which move like wings and churn the air, creating strong winds for the Rito to glide on. Many years later, this ship was used as the Wind Temple - where the Ancient Sage of Wind met Princess Zelda and agreed to prepare his race to fight the Demon King in the future - and so, the Stormwind Ark was not only the source of the strong winds around Rito Village, but the place in which the Rito Sage’s secret stone was stored. The Ark eventually faded into legend, passed down in story and song for generations. Only Rito children still believe - adults know better, and dismiss any sightings of a gigantic flying galleon as mere hearsay. That was, until the Upheaval, when Ganondorf plagued the Rito with an eternal blizzard. They believe that something inside the storm is causing it - but none can fly high enough to investigate. Tulin, however, is an exception. He is the son of Teba, the Rito warrior who had helped Link reach the Divine Beast Vah Medoh during Breath of the Wild. In that game, Tulin was only a fledgling: but in the years since, has grown into an incredibly talented archer. His father has taken over the role of the village Chief from Kaneli, and is forced to devote much of his attention to matters closer to home. But Tulin is bold and confident: despite his father’s warnings, he desperately wants to help his people, and find a solution to the freezing blizzard that plagues them. Like Revali, the Champion of Vah Medoh, Tulin is able to control the wind around him - creating his own gusts of air on which to glide. Together with Link, he begins to climb the Rising Island Chain up into the blistering Hebra skies, and discovers the truth behind the legend of his people. As the pair climb, a voice sounds out from the clouds above: a calling from the Ancient Sage of Wind, who had promised Zelda in the distant past that their descendant would awaken to fight the Demon King. Tulin is this descendant: he is the warrior that his ancestor promised would rise to fight alongside Link. The pair leap across the sails of floating ships dancing in the snowy sky, until they reach the eye of the storm, and are faced with the source of the blizzard: the legendary Stormwind Ark. Link and Tulin witness the puppet of Zelda walking across the Ark’s deck, which contains a giant gate made from six segments. The Zelda clone vanishes, and a torrential gust of wind erupts from beneath the gate: whatever is causing the blizzard must be found below it - but five of the six segments remain shut. The pair explore the sky skip, using Tulin’s power of wind to activate five locks, which, in turn, unlocks the gate. They return to the deck, and Link activates the gate mechanism, releasing the source of the blizzard: Colgera. This frozen monstrosity is, in many ways, a successor to Molgera, the boss of the Wind Temple in The Wind Waker. Like its name suggests, though, Colgera is encased completely in ice, and can harness the wind and produce strong updrafts to keep itself aloft. It had been created by Ganondorf upon his resurrection, with the specific goal of harassing the Rito Tribe and preventing the awakening of their Sage, and the discovery of their secret stone. The beast is incredibly powerful, but so are Link and Tulin - together, the pair duel Colgera in the clouds - eventually destroying it, and restoring peace to the Hebra region. On the deck of the Stormwind Ark, which now floats in calm skies, they discover the Ancient Sage of Wind’s secret stone: which thaws out of a pillar of ice. Like it had been when the Sage had first received it from Rauru in the Forgotten Temple, the stone is white and smooth, a blank canvas yet to react to the abilities of an owner. The Sage of Wind’s spirit speaks to Link and Tulin - explaining the story of the Imprisoning War, and of his promise to Zelda. Tulin understands, and accepts his destiny: he inherits his ancestor’s secret stone, which reacts to his inner power and once again becomes a green stone of Wind. Immediately, Tulin reveals that he possesses a new power: he can create a spiritual avatar of himself. He holds Link’s hand, and transfers this power to Rauru’s arm: marked by a ring on Link’s little finger, swearing to fight alongside him against the darkness. Zelda’s Chosen Knight had defended the Rito from Ganondorf’s assault, and awakened the first of a new generation of Sages to confront him. But his journey was only just beginning: just like he had done years earlier, when he had rescued Hyrule from the clutches of the Calamity, he sets his sights on the three remaining regions. Death Mountain, the home of the Gorons, cools significantly: the lava that had streamed down its rocky slopes dries up, and the volcano’s peak is cloaked in an ominous cloud of Gloom. And the Gorons themselves suffered a terrible fate. During Breath of the Wild, Link had travelled alongside Yunobo, the grandson of the Champion Daruk, to Divine Beast Vah Rudania - whose rampaging was causing violent eruptions, making mining the mountain difficult. Some time after Link calmed the beast, the mountain fell dormant: opening up access to new caves and ore deposits on its rocky slopes. Yunobo founded YunoboCo: a mining company - which became successful enough to effectively run Goron City. After the Upheaval, however, Yunobo began receiving instructions from Ganondorf’s puppet: it gave him a new mask, which seized control of his mind, completely changing his personality. Gorons usually dine on a diet of rocks directly from the mountain, like the classic Rock Roast, but YunoboCo began to mine for Marbled Rock Roast: which glows red with Gloom. Gorons who consume Marbled Rock Roast are literally stoned, they are lulled into a trancelike state, and their eyes glow an eerie purple. So, by the time Link arrives on Death Mountain, most of the Gorons have been enslaved to this new food - they refuse to talk, work, or do anything other than sit and gorge themselves on the rock. Only the very young and very old are unaffected: they’re unable to digest the new rock, but are too weak, or too afraid, to stop Yunobo’s operation. Only Link is brave enough to confront him. He still recognises the Hero from their previous adventure, but the puppet of Zelda uses the mask to force him into a frenzy. Once the mask is broken, however, Yunobo returns to his former self: everything that has happened since he put it on is only remembered as a blur. The Goron is shocked to see the red haze of Gloom surrounding Death Mountain’s peak: but the children aren’t. They remember this happening during the Upheaval: as soon as the castle rose into the air, the red mist began to choke the mountaintop. Yunobo had apparently gone to investigate: but when he returned, was wearing the mysterious mask, warning everyone to stay clear of the peak. The Goron and the Hylian embark on another journey together: to the summit of Death Mountain. Here, puppet Zelda unleashes Moragia: a titanic beast of living rock, rising from the summit of the volcano. Moragia’s name is similar to Volvagia, the dragon boss of the Fire Temple in Ocarina of Time, and sure enough, it takes the form of three dragon-like heads of stone. According to its Hyrule Compendium entry, its body is composed of boiling lava and hard rocks infused with Gloom, which it holds together by drawing both heat and Gloom power from the crater. By riding a Zonai plane that had fallen from the skies and conveniently landed on the mountain during the Upheaval, Link and Yunobo destroy the three heads of Moragia, opening up the mountain’s crater to reveal a gigantic chasm, a portal to the Depths below the region. Like Tulin, Yunobo is the distant descendant of an Ancient Sage - who calls out from the Fire Temple in the deep. Like the Stormwind Ark, the Temple used by the Ancient Goron Sage is a sign of a close bond between his race and the Zonai: the forgotten city of Gorondia. This towering structure built with Zonai stonework was once the home of the Gorons in the distant past, but was abandoned and lost in myth. Legends tell of its advanced technology and strange vehicles, but none alive had seen it until Yunobo and Link enter, in pursuit of the puppet. Here they fight Marbled Gohma: the source of the Marbled Rock Roast, a fiery member of the Gohma family, quite similar to the Wind Waker’s first boss. Yunobo’s power can shatter its legs, leaving its vulnerable eye exposed to Link’s blades - the pair destroy the monster, and Yunobo is awakened as the Sage of Fire. Zora’s Domain is plagued by the Sky Islands directly above it - the reappearance of the Water Temple, which was once the source of their pure water. However, Ganondorf’s power has caused a toxic sludge to pour from these islands, sullying the Domain’s waters and injuring any Zora who comes into contact with it. At one point, the doppelganger of Zelda attacked the Zora King Dorephan - unleashing a sludge monster in an attempt on his life. Dorephan had previously defended his domain from a Guardian, so he of course was able to defeat the foe, but not before taking considerable damage from the toxic substance. He retreats to his secret spring, so that word does not spread of the fact that he was attacked by Hyrule’s Princess and cause panic. Dorephan’s son, Prince Sidon, is incredibly gifted with the ability to control water. This is something that all Zora are able to do, to a certain extent, but Sidon’s powers exceed all others. He is forced to almost single handedly bear the brunt of the poisonous sludge raining from the Water Temple - purifying it as quickly as he can to prevent it reaching the Domain just below. At some point between Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, Sidon married Yona: a Zora who is, apparently, native to an entirely different domain somewhere in the world. This means that there are more Zora found outside of Hyrule - this world is bigger than just this single country. Sidon holds back the sludge atop Ploymus Mountain, where Link fought a Lynel in Breath of the Wild. Since then, it has been repurposed - a shrine has been constructed to honour Sidon’s older sister, known as Mipha Court. The statue of the Princess has been moved from the domain to here, replaced with one immortalising Sidon and Link’s victory over the Divine Beast Vah Ruta. Prince Sidon is the descendant of the Ancient Zora Sage, and so he pieces together the mystery of the sky islands above his home with Link, eventually uncovering the Ancient Zora Waterworks, and opening a waterfall that allows access to Wellspring Island, and the Water Temple itself. Again, this Temple is the original source of Zora’s Domain’s pure waters - a small group of floating platforms below five giant faucets. Since the Upheaval and the reemergence of the Temple from the skies, it has become the home of Mucktorok, a creation of Ganondorf and the creator of the toxic sludge: a creature related to the smaller Octoroks. Together, Link and Sidon destroy the creature, stopping the endless flow of poison. Sidon not only becomes the Sage of Water, but also Zora’s Domain’s King: his father, concerned that he allowed himself to be hurt by a monster, believes it is time for him to pass the torch to his son. King Sidon is crowned, alongside his wife: Queen Yona. The air in the Gerudo Desert is choked by a sandstorm, and the ground itself gives way to quicksand and sinkholes. Worse still, the dead stalk the dunes: Gibdos, horrifying creatures somewhere between zombies and insects, force the Gerudo underground, where they shelter in an ancient bunker below the Throne Room. The source of the sandstorm and the Gibdos that hide in it is Queen Gibdo - a giant insect that whips the sand up into a storm with its wings. Together with Riju, the chief of the Gerudo, the same vai who Link had subdued Vah Naboris with during Breath of the Wild, Link uncovers the secret of the Lightning Temple from an ancient tablet beneath Gerudo Town, and the dungeon rises from the sands. It is a gigantic pyramid, built by the Zonai and the Gerudo in the distant past. Aside from being the elemental Temple of the Ancient Sage of Lightning, we don’t know anything about this place and what it was used for for certain. Great statues of heroines stare down from the top, and tombs full of Gibdos lurk in the shadows. By defeating Queen Gohma in the highest room in the Temple, Link and Riju uncover the fourth secret stone, and the Gerudo Chief swears to offer her support to Link as the new Sage of Lightning - vowing to use her powerful control of electricity against the Demon King. I mentioned in part 1 that the Ancient Sages all wear masks resembling the heads of the four Sheikah Divine Beasts, but their Temples strengthen this connection. Each Temple features an animal motif that matches the Divine Beasts: the Stormwind Ark of course features bird designs, the Fire Temple’s boss chamber includes designs resembling Vah Rudania’s head, the Water Temple’s faucets are shaped like elephants, and the Lightning Temple features camel designs, as well as the six eyes of Vah Naboris. Much of the story of these Ancient Sages is still a mystery, but it seems that they were the inspiration for the Divine Beasts. After awakening the Sages, Link returns to Lookout Landing, where Purah stands looking through the telescope at the castle. By rescuing the four regions from Ganondorf’s creations, Link has started to rally the Kingdom, to gather and mobilise its forces against the Demon King. Members from each race can now be found at Lookout Landing, diligently preparing for the battle ahead. Purah looks through her telescope at the castle… and spots Princess Zelda, standing amidst a burning red sky. The plan changes: Link must now reach the floating citadel, and uncover the truth of this Zelda clone. Finally, just as it had been during Breath of the Wild, Hyrule Castle was Link’s target. He had previously learned from Zelda’s diary, found in the house in Hateno Village, that she had arranged for a new and improved Champion’s Tunic to be crafted for him - and hid it in a secret compartment in the castle’s throne room. This is a little strange, as we saw Link wearing these new, improved Champion’s Leathers at the very beginning of the game, where they were burned by Ganondorf’s Gloom, but regardless - he lights two fires to unlock the chest, once again donning his iconic blue. In the ancient halls of the seat of the Royal Family, the fortress he had once stormed to purge Calamity Ganon from the land, Link finally corners the doppelganger. She uses her magic to create an illusion, to temporarily restore the Castle’s Sanctum to its former glory - fitting, for the last thing Link will ever see. Above Zelda, a spectral image appears - the unmistakable form of Ganondorf, withered after his long imprisonment. The Demon King taunts, and then reveals the truth. Zelda falls limp, hanging like a puppet on strings, then dissolves into Gloom: which gathers, and collects into the dark shape of Phantom Ganon, the Demon King’s secret saboteur. Phantom Ganon has appeared numerous times before in the series: a ghost created by Ganondorf to do\n",

      "Consolidated Context from ChromaDB: a tail. Perhaps they were a different type or class of Zonai, or an entirely different species who once lived in this subterranean world. Eventually, with Link’s help, Josha’s research progresses. She completes the ancient mural, depicting Rauru using a magical ability in an underground temple: what is now the Central Abandoned Mine: one of the facilities the Zonai had used to process Zonaite into energy. Curiously, all of the Zonai mines in the Depths are situated directly beneath the locations of towns on the Surface - and the Central Mine is no different. Although the Great Plateau is now in ruins, it was once the centre of Rauru’s Kingdom of Hyrule: it was where his Temple of Time and Hyrule Castle were found - as the Old Man states in Breath of the Wild, it was the birthplace of the Kingdom. But now that the Zonai are gone, their mines are empty: abandoned by all but Constructs and the spirits of the dead. But the Central Abandoned Mine isn’t Abandoned any more. During Breath of the Wild, Link was tasked with retrieving the Thunder Helm - a priceless artefact stolen from the Gerudo. It was stolen by the Yiga Clan: a militant group of Sheikah whose ancestry traces back to the split in the tribe, when an old King had outlawed their advanced technology. Relatively recently, these shunned Sheikah began to worship Ganon, lurking in an old Gerudo shrine north of the desert. They were led by Master Kohga: a bumbling, yet lovable idiot who, during his showdown with Link, ends up defeating himself: and falls down a seemingly bottomless pit. But this wasn’t the end of Kohga. This hole, it turns out, led to the Depths. The Yiga Master survived - and had discovered an entire new world. Over the next few years, the Yiga Clan had expanded into the Depths: they built strongholds and storerooms, and even began to experiment with ancient Zonai technology: building defence systems and vehicles with incredible names, like the Gloomdredger, or HOVERDOOM MK.3. Master Kohga commanded an almost godlike presence among the Yiga Clan. But he himself worshipped a greater evil: Ganondorf. The Yiga Clan had sworn allegiance to the Calamity Ganon over a century earlier, and now that the true threat had awoken, the fallen Sheikah once again gathered to support him: calling him the Magnificent One. Kohga and the Yiga live for vengeance: sworn to bring ruin upon Princess Zelda and her Kingdom, and of course, to kill their sworn enemy: Link. One focus of the Yiga Clan’s expeditions into the Depths was searching for a forgotten Zonai power. The Clan pored through musty old texts, and hunted through ancient Zonai ruins, all in search of the Autobuild power - the ability to instantly replicate Zonai vehicles, rather than painstakingly building them by hand. So, when Link just strolls into the Central Abandoned Mine and takes the power for himself, Kohga is understandably quite annoyed. Because Link now possesses King Rauru’s right arm, he’s able to open Zonai seals - something which is completely impossible for the Yiga, barring them from activating the Constructs and unlocking the Zonai’s secrets. Link encounters the Yiga Master multiple times throughout the Depths, at the Abandoned Mines underneath towns. At each of them, Kohga vows to destroy Link using increasingly ridiculous vehicles. But no matter what monstrosity he brings to bear against the Hero, it inevitably has the same result: leaving Kohga battered and bruised, and his inventions in broken pieces. Kohga eventually gives up on trying to steal the Autobuild power back from Link, and instead commits himself to Plan B. He claims that the Yiga have been gathering as much Zonai energy as they can, in the form of the crystallised charges Link can use to expand his own Zonai Energy Cells, in order to build a final weapon: an ultimate machine to offer to the Demon King, with which he will bring the world to its end. This weapon is a giant Construct - exactly like the one built by Mineru in the distant past as a vessel for her spirit. This had been her greatest achievement - a machine so large that Zelda once rode on its shoulders. Kohga’s Construct is, of course, decorated with Yiga symbols, and uses powers like force shields and spiked projectiles against Link. But even this isn’t enough - even the ultimate Yiga creation is bested by the Hero. Kohga has only one option left - a brand new technique he developed in the deepest darkness of the darkest Depths: the Kohga Rocket. But, just like he had done during his first showdown with Link during Breath of the Wild… Kohga’s ultimate technique ends up defeating himself. The Kohga Rocket instead hits its master, sending him careening through the Depths like a human firework, launching him up through a Chasm, where he vanishes: all the while screaming that he will have his revenge. Link’s quest through the Depths gives an insight into the mysteries of the ancient Zonai and their mining operations. But his main journey takes place in the world above, where he rallies Hyrule together against the evil that threatens it.

At this point, even Link is unaware of the figure’s true identity and purpose. And this phantom was involved in the orchestration of existential threats in Hyrule’s four main regions.

His father has taken over the role of the village Chief from Kaneli, and is forced to devote much of his attention to matters closer to home. But Tulin is bold and confident: despite his father’s warnings, he desperately wants to help his people, and find a solution to the freezing blizzard that plagues them. Like Revali, the Champion of Vah Medoh, Tulin is able to control the wind around him - creating his own gusts of air on which to glide.

Tulin understands, and accepts his destiny: he inherits his ancestor’s secret stone, which reacts to his inner power and once again becomes a green stone of Wind. Immediately, Tulin reveals that he possesses a new power: he can create a spiritual avatar of himself. He holds Link’s hand, and transfers this power to Rauru’s arm: marked by a ring on Link’s little finger, swearing to fight alongside him against the darkness. Zelda’s Chosen Knight had defended the Rito from Ganondorf’s assault, and awakened the first of a new generation of Sages to confront him. But his journey was only just beginning: just like he had done years earlier, when he had rescued Hyrule from the clutches of the Calamity, he sets his sights on the three remaining regions. Death Mountain, the home of the Gorons, cools significantly: the lava that had streamed down its rocky slopes dries up, and the volcano’s peak is cloaked in an ominous cloud of Gloom. And the Gorons themselves suffered a terrible fate. During Breath of the Wild, Link had travelled alongside Yunobo, the grandson of the Champion Daruk, to Divine Beast Vah Rudania - whose rampaging was causing violent eruptions, making mining the mountain difficult. Some time after Link calmed the beast, the mountain fell dormant: opening up access to new caves and ore deposits on its rocky slopes. Yunobo founded YunoboCo: a mining company - which became successful enough to effectively run Goron City. After the Upheaval, however, Yunobo began receiving instructions from Ganondorf’s puppet: it gave him a new mask, which seized control of his mind, completely changing his personality. Gorons usually dine on a diet of rocks directly from the mountain, like the classic Rock Roast, but YunoboCo began to mine for Marbled Rock Roast: which glows red with Gloom. Gorons who consume Marbled Rock Roast are literally stoned, they are lulled into a trancelike state, and their eyes glow an eerie purple. So, by the time Link arrives on Death Mountain, most of the Gorons have been enslaved to this new food - they refuse to talk, work, or do anything other than sit and gorge themselves on the rock. Only the very young and very old are unaffected: they’re unable to digest the new rock, but are too weak, or too afraid, to stop Yunobo’s operation. Only Link is brave enough to confront him. He still recognises the Hero from their previous adventure, but the puppet of Zelda uses the mask to force him into a frenzy. Once the mask is broken, however, Yunobo returns to his former self: everything that has happened since he put it on is only remembered as a blur. The Goron is shocked to see the red haze of Gloom surrounding Death Mountain’s peak: but the children aren’t. They remember this happening during the Upheaval: as soon as the castle rose into the air, the red mist began to choke the mountaintop. Yunobo had apparently gone to investigate: but when he returned, was wearing the mysterious mask, warning everyone to stay clear of the peak. The Goron and the Hylian embark on another journey together: to the summit of Death Mountain. Here, puppet Zelda unleashes Moragia: a titanic beast of living rock, rising from the summit of the volcano. Moragia’s name is similar to Volvagia, the dragon boss of the Fire Temple in Ocarina of Time, and sure enough, it takes the form of three dragon-like heads of stone. According to its Hyrule Compendium entry, its body is composed of boiling lava and hard rocks infused with Gloom, which it holds together by drawing both heat and Gloom power from the crater. By riding a Zonai plane that had fallen from the skies and conveniently landed on the mountain during the Upheaval, Link and Yunobo destroy the three heads of Moragia, opening up the mountain’s crater to reveal a gigantic chasm, a portal to the Depths below the region. Like Tulin, Yunobo is the distant descendant of an Ancient Sage - who calls out from the Fire Temple in the deep. Like the Stormwind Ark, the Temple used by the Ancient Goron Sage is a sign of a close bond between his race and the Zonai: the forgotten city of Gorondia. This towering structure built with Zonai stonework was once the home of the Gorons in the distant past, but was abandoned and lost in myth. Legends tell of its advanced technology and strange vehicles, but none alive had seen it until Yunobo and Link enter, in pursuit of the puppet. Here they fight Marbled Gohma: the source of the Marbled Rock Roast, a fiery member of the Gohma family, quite similar to the Wind Waker’s first boss. Yunobo’s power can shatter its legs, leaving its vulnerable eye exposed to Link’s blades - the pair destroy the monster, and Yunobo is awakened as the Sage of Fire. Zora’s Domain is plagued by the Sky Islands directly above it - the reappearance of the Water Temple, which was once the source of their pure water. However, Ganondorf’s power has caused a toxic sludge to pour from these islands, sullying the Domain’s waters and injuring any Zora who comes into contact with it. At one point, the doppelganger of Zelda attacked the Zora King Dorephan - unleashing a sludge monster in an attempt on his life. Dorephan had previously defended his domain from a Guardian, so he of course was able to defeat the foe, but not before taking considerable damage from the toxic substance. He retreats to his secret spring, so that word does not spread of the fact that he was attacked by Hyrule’s Princess and cause panic. Dorephan’s son, Prince Sidon, is incredibly gifted with the ability to control water. This is something that all Zora are able to do, to a certain extent, but Sidon’s powers exceed all others. He is forced to almost single handedly bear the brunt of the poisonous sludge raining from the Water Temple - purifying it as quickly as he can to prevent it reaching the Domain just below. At some point between Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, Sidon married Yona: a Zora who is, apparently, native to an entirely different domain somewhere in the world. This means that there are more Zora found outside of Hyrule - this world is bigger than just this single country. Sidon holds back the sludge atop Ploymus Mountain, where Link fought a Lynel in Breath of the Wild. Since then, it has been repurposed - a shrine has been constructed to honour Sidon’s older sister, known as Mipha Court. The statue of the Princess has been moved from the domain to here, replaced with one immortalising Sidon and Link’s victory over the Divine Beast Vah Ruta. Prince Sidon is the descendant of the Ancient Zora Sage, and so he pieces together the mystery of the sky islands above his home with Link, eventually uncovering the Ancient Zora Waterworks, and opening a waterfall that allows access to Wellspring Island, and the Water Temple itself. Again, this Temple is the original source of Zora’s Domain’s pure waters - a small group of floating platforms below five giant faucets. Since the Upheaval and the reemergence of the Temple from the skies, it has become the home of Mucktorok, a creation of Ganondorf and the creator of the toxic sludge: a creature related to the smaller Octoroks. Together, Link and Sidon destroy the creature, stopping the endless flow of poison. Sidon not only becomes the Sage of Water, but also Zora’s Domain’s King: his father, concerned that he allowed himself to be hurt by a monster, believes it is time for him to pass the torch to his son. King Sidon is crowned, alongside his wife: Queen Yona. The air in the Gerudo Desert is choked by a sandstorm, and the ground itself gives way to quicksand and sinkholes. Worse still, the dead stalk the dunes: Gibdos, horrifying creatures somewhere between zombies and insects, force the Gerudo underground, where they shelter in an ancient bunker below the Throne Room. The source of the sandstorm and the Gibdos that hide in it is Queen Gibdo - a giant insect that whips the sand up into a storm with its wings. Together with Riju, the chief of the Gerudo, the same vai who Link had subdued Vah Naboris with during Breath of the Wild, Link uncovers the secret of the Lightning Temple from an ancient tablet beneath Gerudo Town, and the dungeon rises from the sands. It is a gigantic pyramid, built by the Zonai and the Gerudo in the distant past. Aside from being the elemental Temple of the Ancient Sage of Lightning, we don’t know anything about this place and what it was used for for certain. Great statues of heroines stare down from the top, and tombs full of Gibdos lurk in the shadows. By defeating Queen Gohma in the highest room in the Temple, Link and Riju uncover the fourth secret stone, and the Gerudo Chief swears to offer her support to Link as the new Sage of Lightning - vowing to use her powerful control of electricity against the Demon King. I mentioned in part 1 that the Ancient Sages all wear masks resembling the heads of the four Sheikah Divine Beasts, but their Temples strengthen this connection. Each Temple features an animal motif that matches the Divine Beasts: the Stormwind Ark of course features bird designs, the Fire Temple’s boss chamber includes designs resembling Vah Rudania’s head, the Water Temple’s faucets are shaped like elephants, and the Lightning Temple features camel designs, as well as the six eyes of Vah Naboris. Much of the story of these Ancient Sages is still a mystery, but it seems that they were the inspiration for the Divine Beasts. After awakening the Sages, Link returns to Lookout Landing, where Purah stands looking through the telescope at the castle. By rescuing the four regions from Ganondorf’s creations, Link has started to rally the Kingdom, to gather and mobilise its forces against the Demon King. Members from each race can now be found at Lookout Landing, diligently preparing for the battle ahead. Purah looks through her telescope at the castle… and spots Princess Zelda, standing amidst a burning red sky. The plan changes: Link must now reach the floating citadel, and uncover the truth of this Zelda clone. Finally, just as it had been during Breath of the Wild, Hyrule Castle was Link’s target. He had previously learned from Zelda’s diary, found in the house in Hateno Village, that she had arranged for a new and improved Champion’s Tunic to be crafted for him - and hid it in a secret compartment in the castle’s throne room. This is a little strange, as we saw Link wearing these new, improved Champion’s Leathers at the very beginning of the game, where they were burned by Ganondorf’s Gloom, but regardless - he lights two fires to unlock the chest, once again donning his iconic blue. In the ancient halls of the seat of the Royal Family, the fortress he had once stormed to purge Calamity Ganon from the land, Link finally corners the doppelganger. She uses her magic to create an illusion, to temporarily restore the Castle’s Sanctum to its former glory - fitting, for the last thing Link will ever see. Above Zelda, a spectral image appears - the unmistakable form of Ganondorf, withered after his long imprisonment. The Demon King taunts, and then reveals the truth. Zelda falls limp, hanging like a puppet on strings, then dissolves into Gloom: which gathers, and collects into the dark shape of Phantom Ganon, the Demon King’s secret saboteur. Phantom Ganon has appeared numerous times before in the series: a ghost created by Ganondorf to do\n",

      "Consolidated Context from ChromaDB: Ganondorf’s resurrection changed Hyrule forever. The Kingdom’s Princess, and her Chosen Knight, seemingly both disappeared on their expedition below the Surface. Hyrule Castle itself was thrust into the sky, floating above a gigantic pit of Gloom. The world shook and the earth split, opening up not only entrances to deep networks of caves, but Chasms: like red wounds on Hyrule’s surface, each a portal to the hellish Depths below. And stranger still, floating islands appeared in the sky: chunks of ancient stone rained down from above. This event became known as The Upheaval: a Kingdom just barely beginning to rebuild was once again thrown into chaos. The re-emergence of Ganondorf’s power affected Hyrule in different ways. The first, and most dangerous, was the return of his monsters in full force. Ganondorf’s minions are stronger even than those who followed the Calamity Ganon: each is equipped with a deadly horn, and, rather than being scattered in small encampments, they begin to organise themselves into more dangerous groups. Pirates raid the coasts and rivers, and crude fortresses are built, controlled by powerful Bokoblin leaders. The Upheaval also marks the return of ancient terrors like the Gleeok, a mighty three headed dragon. The Demon King’s corrosive Gloom also had the countrywide effect of decaying weapons: just like the Ancient Sages weapons during their confrontations, and the Master Sword itself, all blades across Hyrule are corroded by the substance. Worse still, the Kingdom becomes once again trapped in the terrible cycle of the Blood Moon: just like when the Calamity Ganon lurked in the Castle, Ganondorf’s power occasionally surges, summoning a cruel phenomenon where all of his slain monsters return to life. Hyrule is trapped in a war against the Demon King’s never ending armies, forced to defend their country with broken weapons. The breaking of the seal coincided with the appearance of Sky Islands all across Hyrule - all Zonai in origin - they are suspended by their magic, and populated by Constructs, their mechanical servants. Most impressive of all is the Great Sky Island, a gigantic landmass floating in the south east of Central Hyrule. These islands have existed, somewhere in Hyrule’s skies, ever since the time of King Rauru. How they were hidden all this time, and why they appear now that Ganondorf has returned, is something of a mystery: we can only assume that this was all designed by the ancients as part of a greater plan. It’s possible that, up until now, the Zonai’s Sky Islands were obscured by the Cloud Barrier. This was a magical plane built by the Goddess Hylia long before the events of Skyward Sword, in order to hide Skyloft and protect it from Demise on the Surface. The barrier renders anything above it completely invisible from the Surface, and travel between the ground and sky is only possible once parts of the barrier are dispelled. Ruins rained down from the sky - which of course attracted the attention of Zelda’s Zonai Survey Team. The group began investigating the Zonai relics as soon as they fell: in particular, the peculiar ring shaped ruins that rained on Kakariko Village, which became the team’s de facto base. The team noted the sudden appearance of glowing rocks, which they decided to name “shrines” - correctly identifying them as Zonai Shrines of Light, created by Rauru in the distant past. These appeared overnight - nobody knows how or why - if they fell from the sky or emerged from the ground. With Link and Zelda vanishing mysteriously below the castle, a search and rescue operation was organised by Purah, based at Lookout Landing. Wanted posters were drawn up and pasted around, and search parties routinely scoured the castle for any sign of the missing pair. The giant Sheikah telescope from the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab was moved to central Hyrule, where it was pointed at the newly floating Hyrule Castle for observation. The Upheaval had caused Hyrule to mobilise and focus its strength - desperate to solve its mysteries and defend themselves from its dangers. Their salvation would come from the skies. Link wakes in an unfamiliar cave, full of giant roots and old stone. It’s unclear how much time has passed since the events in the Imprisoning Chamber - but it’s likely not much longer than a few weeks. He finds that his right arm, that had been terribly wounded by Ganondorf’s attack, has been healed somehow: it now glows with a green light, and is covered in an ornate brace. Not only had Rauru’s arm caught Link from falling and hauled him up into the safety of the skies, it had fused with Link’s lost limb. Through the arm, the King of Light speaks to Link, glad that the Knight has woken up. He explains that Link’s arm was beyond saving, and needed replacing to stop the affliction from endangering him any further, as well as cryptically mentioning that he has heard a lot about the Hero from Zelda. At this point, Link knows nothing about Zelda’s fate - he knows that she fell into a crevice deep below the Castle, but not that she ended up in the past. Rauru, of course, knows her story up until the confrontation with Ganondorf - he knows that she time travelled to his era. Just nearby, Link finds the Master Sword, buried in roots. With his new arm, he draws his sword… but it is decayed, it has been ravaged by Gloom, and half of the blade is missing. What little remains looks like it has been melted, and its sacred power has all but withered away. Regardless, with the sword on his back, Link leaves the Room of Awakening, makes his way through ancient Zonai tunnels, and out into broad daylight. He leaps from a podium, and begins his first fall through the open sky. Injured, confused, but nonetheless determined, Link’s adventure begins. After landing on the Great Sky Island, breaking his fall in a deep lake, Link is greeted by a Steward Construct - which delivers to him the Purah Pad. This Construct is the same one Zelda gave the device to just before she swallowed her secret stone, and has held it for thousands of years. The device still contains Mineru’s spirit - though, for the time being, she is not able to communicate, and, of course, features a map function, which curiously shows Zelda’s location as inside the Temple of Time. This Construct describes this area as the Garden of Time, a site of ancient ceremonies surrounding the Temple, now abandoned and forgotten. During Rauru and Sonia’s time, this landmass was found on Hyrule’s surface - evident from the presence of the Zonai Temple of Time that had originally been found on the Great Plateau - until it was raised by the power of the Sages under Zelda’s instruction: specifically to serve as a safe haven where Link could recover from the Gloom. Link finds that Rauru’s arm is able to activate Zonai locks, just like the ones the King opened in the past. He begins to explore the Great Sky Island: a sad, lonely place with seas of golden trees, and in their shadows, the ruins of houses and temples from the distant past. He follows the Purah Pad’s guidance, and travels to the Temple of Time… but he finds its door tightly locked. His arm glows, and Rauru’s voice once again sounds out… and this time, it’s accompanied by his spirit. With no physical body remaining, the King of Light is forced to stand before Link as a spectre, and explains that the Hero’s right arm originally belonged to him. He claims that the arm should have the power to open the Temple of Time’s door, like how it can open other Zonai locks, but it must have lost some of its sacred light over the thousands of years it imprisoned Ganondorf. He directs Link to visit the Shrines of Light found on the island, the holy structures he had created long ago to seal and purify evil, sanctuaries filled with his own power. Link journeys across the Great Sky Island, finding and visiting three Shrines. It seems that they no longer only serve their original purpose of warding away evil, they now house challenges for Link - which, just like the Ancient Sheikah Shrines from Breath of the Wild, are designed to train and temper him into a weapon capable of defeating evil. The Light within each of them is enough to restore one of the abilities Rauru’s arm has lost - Ultrahand, the power to move and manipulate objects, Fuse, the power to combine materials and weapons, and Ascend, the power to swim upwards through solid objects. And at the end of each Shrine, Link finds a statue of its creators: King Rauru and Queen Sonia, at the base of a spiral of sacred energy. Each Shrine grants him a Light of Blessing, a crystal glowing with Rauru’s power that purges the evil that still lurks within Link after Ganondorf’s assault, bringing him a step closer to recovering the strength he lost to the Gloom. At various points on this lonely island, Rauru’s spirit can be found quietly observing the remains of his Garden of Time. He watches the Constructs, still quietly carrying out their duties after all this time, and finds it unsettling that they continue even now. For millennia, the Constructs have continued to serve masters that no longer exist: they cook and clean and protect the Sky Islands, entirely unaware that they are now the caretakers of ruins. Some Constructs have stopped working entirely, and are now found broken and half-buried in ancient dust. Rauru notes that he had created the Steward Constructs first, and the others came later - that they each became so skilled at their tasks that he began learning from them. He also claims that Zonai devices - gadgets like Wings and Fans and Rockets, were the pinnacle of his technology - that with them, he built an advanced civilisation that flourished for many years. At one point, the Steward Construct which had given Link the Purah Pad catches up with him to provide him with another tool: a Zonai Energy Cell. This can be fuelled with Crystallised Charges, and then used to provide energy for nearby Zonai technology - allowing Link to use the machinery to his advantage. Rauru’s spirit stands and takes in the magnificence of the Temple of Time, and explains that this was a quiet place, the silence only ever broken by the ringing of the time bell every morning and evening. Both the Zonai and their Constructs woke and rested on the chimes of the bell, and it played a role in their traditions and ceremonies. The Temple itself, and its time bell, were this place’s beating heart. He also muses that in his time, the Garden of Time was found not in the sky, but on the Surface: showing that he was not aware of Zelda’s plan to lift the Temple of Time into the sky for Link to awaken there. However, it was Rauru’s hand that had caught Link and dragged him up into the sky. In the distant past, Zelda had warned Rauru of the seal breaking, and of Ganondorf’s attack - so perhaps the two had always planned for the King of Light to take Link to the Room of Awakening after the Demon King’s resurrection, but was unaware that it, and the Great Sky Island below it, would be lifted skyward by Zelda after the Imprisoning War ended. Once Link has strengthened his arm with three Lights of Blessing, he is able to unlock the Temple of Time’s door, and enter the sanctuary. Inside, he finds a room of spinning gears, just like those in the room near where he awoke, but more importantly: a giant, translucent projection of a Zonai secret stone, glowing yellow, marked with the unmistakable symbol for Time. Link touches the stone, and a blinding light fills the room… When he opens his eyes, he finds himself in a strange place - an illusory plane with endless fog in every direction, and the symbol for Time projected in the air. In front of Link, Princess Zelda herself appears: her eyes closed, and her hands cupped together. Behind her are the altar and spinning gears from the Temple of Time. Zelda holds out her right arm, and Link reaches up to grasp her hand in his. Immediately, Zelda glows a brilliant gold - a light which travels down her arm, through her hand, and into Link - whose right arm shines with the same light, before it concentrates on the back of his hand, and forms the symbol for Time. Another flash of light brings Link back to the Temple of Time… and Zelda has gone. Rauru’s spirit appears to explain: Link’s right arm now possesses the Recall ability, the same power used by Zelda and Sonia, where an object can be traced backwards through time. Rauru notes that this mysterious projection of the Princess is a mystery even to him - one possibility is that, from the distant past, she was able to use her powers to create an echo through time, so that, in some way, she could reach Link and share her ability with him. She had stood in this same spot in the Temple of Time in the past, shortly after Rauru had sealed the Demon King. Of course, Zelda exists in the present, too - thousands of years ago, she performed the forbidden act of draconification in order to empower the Master Sword, transforming her into the Light Dragon. This stripped Zelda of almost everything that made her her - dooming her to wander the skies, alone, forever. The Light Dragon is not mindless, though: she is still aware of her purpose, and her plan. She circles just behind the Temple of Time - so, it’s possible that she is able to project a ghostly image of herself, and her secret stone, through sheer force of will. Regardless of how she achieves it, though, Zelda is powerful enough to share her ability to rewind time with Link - allowing him to to manipulate the spinning gears and climb to the back of the Temple. Here, a lone statue of the Goddess Hylia sits in front of a colossal door. The Hero places his hands onto the markings, and pushes with all his might… but it’s not enough. Rauru’s spirit explains that the door is a test of Link’s vitality, and Ganondorf’s attack has left him too weak to open it. However, there remains one more Shrine of Light on the Great Sky Island - found just above the Room of Awakening. Completing this Shrine, which focuses on using the Recall ability, grants Link his fourth Light of Blessing, which, just like Spirit Orbs in Breath of the Wild, can be offered at a Goddess Statue in return for a Heart Container or Stamina Vessel. Finally, with a tiny part of his original strength restored, Link is able to throw open the stone doors, and step out into the back of the Temple of Time. Rauru’s spirit appears before Link one last time. Keeping Ganondorf sealed for thousands of years withered his strength: now, he passes the torch to Zelda’s Knight. He says that he is happy he and Link finally met, that he is exactly as Zelda said. With that, the King of Light’s spirit disappears - fading into tiny particles that dance away on the wind. Link finds himself on a long, broken bridge, jutting out from the Temple into the open sky. This bridge was originally a pathway out from the back of the Temple of Time, the very same spot where Zelda once stood in the distant past, but now that the structure is suspended in the air, it’s considerably more dangerous, and the Hero needs to make use of his arm’s new abilities to reach the end. Here, Link is met with a strange, golden orb of light. When he reaches it, it causes the Recall symbol on the back of his hand to glow. The orb pulses twice, and, to Link’s surprise, the Master Sword does the same - it glows, and calls out twice: the voice of Fi, the Spirit of the Sword. Link holds the broken blade up to the light, the time bell chimes, and… the Master Sword vanishes. Through an exceptionally powerful version of Recall, the blade travels back through time - moving thousands upon thousands of years into the past, where it eventually reaches… Princess Zelda. Zelda had called the Master Sword all the way from the distant past, opening a rift in time through which Link can send the blade using his own Recall power. It doesn’t seem like this was an intentional decision from Zelda: it’s like her powers activated subconsciously, just like they had done when she first travelled through time to the past. The Princess is more powerful than even she is aware of, and her deep strength can awaken when it is most needed. Zelda finally understands her purpose, but, in the exact same spot, thousands of years in the future, stands Link - incredibly confused. The Master Sword vanishes in front of his eyes… and a mighty roar echoes through the skies. The Light Dragon bursts through the clouds, scattering them and revealing the Surface below. If the Sky Islands were originally hidden above the Cloud Barrier, then it seems that the Light Dragon fully breaks it here, opening up the Kingdom of Hyrule to Link. Zelda’s voice sounds out, again either as an echo through time or from the Light Dragon herself: \"Link... Link, you must find me.\" Making Link’s goal clear: he must find his Princess. Without fear, Link leaps from the Great Sky Island, and plummets towards the land below. Despite reaching terminal velocity, a lake is enough to break his fall, just like it had been when he fell from the Room of Awakening. He dries himself off, gets his bearings, and begins another journey through this familiar land - heading for Lookout Landing. People are stunned by his arrival: Link returns as if from beyond the grave. Just as Hyrule once again collapsed into chaos, he had vanished: and yet here he is, defying death, having fallen from the skies like the Gods of old. Outside of the main building, Link meets Josha: a young apprentice working under the scientists Purah and Robbie. Though they’ve apparently never met, she immediately recognises Link and calls for Purah: who bursts out of her study, dishevelled and amazed. She listens keenly as the Hero explains his story so far: ending with Zelda’s voice mysteriously calling out to Link after the Light Dragon parted the clouds. Again - almost nobody surviving in the present day is aware of what happened to Zelda. Her journey in the time of Hyrule’s founding is remembered only by ancient relics, like the Chamberlain’s Tablets or the murals, spirits: such as Rauru, Mineru, and the Ancient Sages, and the Demon King himself. Purah directs Link to Hyrule Castle, where the search party has continued to hunt, tirelessly, for the Princess and her Hero. With the Castle itself suspended in the air by a stone column that rises out of a great chasm, only a small amount of the structure is accessible to the search party - like the First Gatehouse, the Docks and the Lockup, and multiple winding passageways that tunnel through the stone beneath their feet. One such passageway leads all the way south from the Castle, where it connects with Lookout Landing’s Emergency Shelter: a secret hideout found beneath the new town that was once used by the Hyrulean Royal Family in times of danger. Before the town was built, this place was known as the Sacred Grounds: an incredibly important structure used in ceremonies, like the appointment of Link as Zelda’s Chosen Knight. But now, the Royal Family are long gone - and their only surviving member, Zelda, has vanished. The head of the search party is Captain Hoz, found atop the First Gatehouse, peering, fruitlessly, into the great Chasm. He’s understandably shocked to find Link alive, but worries that Zelda still eludes them. Suddenly, a voice cries out: the Princess has been spotted. Atop one of the castle’s broken towers, Zelda stands, looking back at Link and the search party. Wordlessly, she looks to the skies, then begins to levitate - floating upwards until she vanishes in a flash of light. This is, of course, not Zelda: it’s a puppet of Ganondorf - exactly the same magic he used in the distant past to try and assassinate Sonia. Link, however, is still only beginning to piece together what has happened since the Upheaval, and the apparition spooks Captain Hoz enough for the search party to withdraw from the Castle. Link reports back to Purah - who decides that they should change their approach to the problem, and instead focus on research into the Upheaval. To do this, she needs to finish setting up the Skyview Towers: the structures built by Hudson Construction that used Sheikah technology to scan their surroundings. Josha pulls a switch, and every Skyview Tower, in all corners of Hyrule, sends up a flare as it activates. The reason that Purah hadn’t activated the Towers earlier was that, to actually produce the map of an area, they require someone to be launched into the sky above, and manually scan the surroundings with the Purah Pad. This isn’t something just anyone could accomplish: only Link, an adept at paragliding from his previous adventure, can do it. So, Purah gives Link a new paraglider and then, in a cutscene that evokes more than a little bit of a Wind Waker feeling, launches him into the sky, where he scans the surroundings and sends the data back along a wire. Processed data returns along the same cord: and the surroundings’ map is loaded onto the tablet. Now that he is in possession of a map of the surrounding area, Purah points out four regional phenomena: areas that had been particularly affected by the Upheaval. In the distant past, Zelda had sown the seeds of Link’s journey: by planning with the Ancient Sages for their successors to awaken alongside Ganondorf. But when the Demon King had returned: he specifically targeted these regions, knowing that each held a secret stone that could be used against him, and created monsters that would disrupt these areas and their people. Freeing these regions, and awakening a new order of Sages to fight the revived Demon King, is the main focus of Link’s quest. Purah’s assistant, Josha, is the head of Depths research: responsible for studying the incredibly creepy underworld found at the bottom of the Chasms that had opened up since the Upheaval. The Depths have been separated from Hyrule since ancient times, but always lurked beneath it. Together with Robbie, Link investigates the Central Hyrule Chasm, learning the use of Lightroots, connected to Rauru’s Shrines of Light above them, to illuminate the darkness. Research into the Depths had only recently begun, but Josha and her team have already made significant discoveries: they have begun to piece together a stone mural, showing an ancient people who lived in the Depths... the Zonai? The Depths contains statues of Gorons, Zora, Gerudo, and Rito, the four non-Hylian tribes, but also these - with strange, somewhat froglike heads and one fist in the air. These statues represent a fifth race during the distant past, one who lived, and mined in the Depths. It’s implied that these people were the Zonai: but the statues look nothing like Rauru and Mineru, the two remaining Zonai during the time of Hyrule’s founding. The statues could depict whatever race the Ancient Hero was: the face shape is similar, but the statue lacks\n",

      "Consolidated Context from ChromaDB: knows that she can let her spirit move on, to join Rauru and Sonia, and the world will be safe in Zelda’s hands. Just like the ancient King and Queen, Mineru’s spirit is scattered to the wind. Thousands of years ago, Zelda, along with Mineru and the Ancient Sages, had sworn their allegiance to Rauru, the King of Light. They had sworn not only to save Hyrule from the immediate threat of the Demon King, but for it to see eternal peace: to defend it for all time. And now, in the present day, the new Sages do the same: vowing to support Princess Zelda, the descendant of Rauru and Sonia, and to protect her Kingdom forever. Tears of the Kingdom ends on a very positive note: the evil that has threatened Hyrule since the founding of the Kingdom has been destroyed, Zelda was saved from an eternal solitude as a dragon, and a new generation of Sages have sworn to defend the land for all time. After Link and Zelda had destroyed Calamity Ganon at the end of Breath of the Wild, they spent the next few years rebuilding the Kingdom - until the Princess’s disappearance, and the Upheaval, once again threw Hyrule into turmoil. But with Ganondorf’s defeat, the Kingdom is completely free from its curse: Zelda and her Chosen Knight can lead Hyrule into a new age of prosperity - to finally fulfil Zelda’s wish of restoring the land to its former glory, and beyond. Tears of the Kingdom’s developers have said that the game’s key theme was “hands” - symbolising not only the connections Link builds with the new Sages, but between the two time periods the game takes place in: past and present. Link and Zelda’s story splits the second their hands fail to meet: breaking the game’s narrative into two separate halves that mirror each other, only to combine again at the climax. Breath of the Wild saw Link journey across a ruined Kingdom alone, but in Tears of the Kingdom, this is never the case: the Sage’s Vows are represented by rings on his fingers, as if his companions are literally holding his hand as he explores. But Ganondorf’s hands also follow him: the nightmarish Gloom Hands that precede Phantom Ganon are one of the game’s most terrifying and overwhelming enemies, a fitting successor to Breath of the Wild’s signature Guardian. In Tears of the Kingdom, hands are everywhere: from the abilities granted to Link by Rauru’s arm to the sounds of hands clapping in the music - fitting, for a game about connections, about a Kingdom starting to piece itself back together. Thank you so much for watching this video, the final episode of my three part coverage of the main story and lore of Tears of the Kingdom. Like Breath of the Wild, the game reveals its story in a nonlinear fashion - not only how the Dragon’s Tears memories are unlocked, but how important story details like the connection between Ganondorf and the Calamity are only mentioned in dialogue with specific characters. This project is by far the biggest thing I’ve ever done on this channel, it has taken such a massive amount of time to piece together everything about this story and present it. So, if you liked this video, leaving a like would be really appreciated, or if you want more Zelda content, consider subscribing - this won’t be the last time I cover Tears of the Kingdom’s story and lore. Cheers guys, and I'll see you next time. story that has already happened. Tears of the Kingdom, though, was going to be a direct sequel. This game could build on the solid, deep world and lore established by its predecessor, and give us a traditional Zelda story set in the most realistic, believable Hyrule yet. Right? As a direct sequel to Breath of the Wild, the story of Tears of the Kingdom begins a few years after the defeat of Calamity Ganon. During this time, Princess Zelda has begun to rebuild her Kingdom - with the help of Hudson Construction, she oversees the construction of new homes, settlements, and a school for Hyrule’s children. The peace is broken, however, when an insidious substance known as Gloom begins to seep out from beneath Hyrule Castle, poisoning any who come into contact with it. An ancient staircase is discovered leading deep into the Castle’s foundations, and Zelda decides to investigate - accompanied, as always, by her Chosen Knight, Link. The pair journey deep into the bowels of Hyrule Castle - where they eventually discover ancient stonework and statues built by the Zonai, a civilisation mentioned in Hyrule’s earliest records. In a large chamber, they find a set of murals - which appear to depict the founding of the Kingdom of Hyrule and the Imprisoning War that followed shortly afterwards. These murals aren’t only meant to immortalise history, though - they also serve as a warning. The source of the Gloom is found in the next chamber - none other than the body of Ganondorf himself, the Demon King who had waged war in Hyrule’s first days, who has been imprisoned here for thousands of years. As soon as Link and Zelda get close, the seal breaks - the spirit hand holding the Demon King lets him go, dropping a mysterious stone as it does so. Zelda picks the stone up, but before she can examine it - Ganondorf awakens. Though his body is withered, his power is overwhelming - with a surge of Gloom, Ganondorf breaks the Master Sword itself, and cripples Link’s right arm. Another eruption of dark magic collapses the cave - Ganondorf falls into the darkness below… and Zelda falls with him. Though his arm is horrifically scarred, Link leaps after her… and misses. Just as it seems like the Princess will die, the stone she had picked up begins to glow, and she vanishes - having been transported to the distant past. Link is caught by the hand that had sealed Ganondorf, and hauled into the heavens - where he awakens on the Great Sky Island. He soon discovers that Hyrule has changed - the events that followed Ganondorf’s resurrection have become known as the Upheaval. Floating islands covered in Zonai Ruins have appeared in the skies all across Hyrule, and ancient stonework has rained down on the Kingdom below them. Chasms leading down into the Depths have torn apart Hyrule’s surface, and Hyrule Castle itself now floats, ominously, above its own Chasm. Monsters have returned in force to terrorise the Kingdom’s people, and Hyrule’s main races are each affected by their own Regional Phenomena. Strange glyphs have appeared on Hyrule’s surface - glowing shapes that can only be seen from high above. But, most troubling of all… Princess Zelda is missing. The spirit of Rauru, the first King of Hyrule, tells Link that it was his hand that had sealed Ganondorf, and that he has managed to save Link’s right arm by fusing it with his own. Link has been severely weakened by the attack, however - his blade has been broken, and his body ravaged by the Gloom. In order to restore his lost vitality, he must bathe himself in the sacred Light of the Zonai Shrines - each purging some of the darkness that remains within him, and restoring power to his right arm. After obtaining the Ultrahand, Fuse and Ascend abilities he can access the Temple of Time, where he meets with a ghostly projection of Zelda. Wordlessly, the Princess reaches out, and grants him the Recall ability, which, after the fourth tutorial Shrine, Link uses to send the broken Master Sword back in time. With that, Link is set free into Hyrule once again - to uncover the truth of Zelda’s disappearance, to free the four races from their plights, and to defeat the newly awakened Ganondorf. Like with Breath of the Wild, most of Tears of the Kingdom’s story takes place in the past. The present is very static - there are of course a ton of characterful sidequests, the main Regional Phenomena quests, and the main battle against Ganondorf himself, but that’s it. All of the context for the game’s events, anything actually interesting, is locked in the past - experienced not by Link, the player, but Zelda, through cutscenes. Link can uncover Zelda’s story with the Geoglyphs on Hyrule’s surface - each of which contains a Dragon’s Tear, which, by interacting with Link’s Recall ability, will unlock a cutscene showing part of her journey in the distant past. Tears of the Kingdom’s story is the story of Princess Zelda. After being transported from deep below the castle, she finds herself out in the open air, in the Kingdom of Hyrule… but not the Hyrule she knows. She meets Rauru and Sonia, who introduce themselves as Hyrule’s King and Queen, and invite her to stay with them at the castle. These are Hyrule’s first rulers - the couple that began the Royal Family, making Zelda their distant descendent - the powers within her bloodline began with these two. King Rauru holds the power of light - a power that can repel or destroy evil, which is implied to be the reason for Zelda’s sealing power used to defeat the Calamity. And Queen Sonia holds power over time - she can manipulate its flow. The reason Zelda travelled back here was because she picked up Rauru’s Secret Stone - a Zonai artefact designed to amplify the abilities of whoever wields it. This particular stone originally amplified Rauru’s Light powers and helped him to keep Ganondorf imprisoned, but once picked up by Zelda, it began to amplify her own Time powers inherited from Sonia - and so, when faced with certain death, it was Zelda’s own power that saved her, and transported her to the past. Zelda is faced with an impossible challenge - to return to the present, where she knows that a terrible threat has awakened, and Link is injured. But she doesn’t yet know how to control her powers - she is trapped here. And the past isn’t any safer than the present - Zelda has travelled back to the earliest days of the Imprisoning War that was marked on the stone murals - Ganondorf, the King of the Gerudo Tribe, aims to take control of the land from Rauru, and rule Hyrule himself. Throughout the memories, we see Zelda train her time powers, in hopes that she will be able to use them to return home. She spends time with the Royal Couple, as well as Mineru, the King’s sister - though she is trapped in this time against her will, she falls in love with these characters. Zelda lost her mother when she was only six years old, and her father, King Rhoam, died during the Great Calamity. So, in essence, King Rauru and Queen Sonia fill this parental role: they are her own blood, and they care for her like she is their child. Though she is thousands of years removed from her own time… the past becomes a second home. And so, when the Imprisoning War breaks out, Zelda is as affected by it as anyone else. She is appointed the Sage of Time by Rauru, who gives out Zonai Secret Stones to the leaders of Hyrule’s four races, and faces the Demon King alongside them. After the final battle, the one the player will see five times in cutscenes following the main dungeons, Zelda is at a loss. Rauru is gone, Mineru is wounded, and Zelda is still stuck in the past - desperate to find her purpose here, and a way to get home. And then… a golden light appears just outside of the Temple of Time, and from it… the broken Master Sword appears. Through Zelda’s time powers, Link’s Recall power, or a combination of the two, the Master Sword was able to travel back to the distant past - into Zelda’s hands. With this, she understands. It had been her own powers that had caused her to travel to the past, and now she knows why: she must play a critical role in the battle against the Demon King, and deliver her Knight the weapon which could undo him. She must bathe the Master Sword in her own Light power, to restore it, and to imbue it with enough sacred force to repel Ganondorf. But like Mineru had said, there was only one way to live long enough to see the present day: the forbidden act of draconification. Zelda’s sacrifice is Tears of the Kingdom’s defining moment, and it’s one of the most impactful story beats in the series. Although she is using an artefact created by the godlike Zonai for a good reason, it feels… wrong: Zelda’s reaction to swallowing the stone is heartbreaking - she is giving up her autonomy, her life, her soul in order to save her Kingdom. Her final words are spoken to Link, but they describe her own motivations: she is Hyrule’s Princess, and she is willing to give everything to protect her people. The Light Dragon is visible right from the beginning of Link’s adventure - it circles the Great Sky Island during the tutorial, and breaks the Cloud Barrier obscuring the Surface. It’s been here, high above the clouds, for thousands upon thousands of years - Zelda has watched over the entirety of this Hyrule’s history, silently waiting for the time she knows as the present, and for her Chosen Knight. This makes Tears of the Kingdom’s Master Sword pull one of the very best in the whole Zelda series. This is always among the most defining moments of every game - Link finally discovers the legendary blade of evil’s bane, and pulls it to symbolise the completion of his transformation into the Hero. This time, he pulls the blade from the head of the Light Dragon, Zelda herself. The gravity of what she has done so that this sword could reach Link makes this moment so impactful - Zelda has given everything, and now the final battle falls on Link. Speaking of the final battle… Tears of the Kingdom’s ending could well be the game at its absolute strongest. Like with Breath of the Wild, the ending of the game can be accessed without completing any of the main quests - Ganondorf lurks deep below Hyrule Castle, even deeper into the tunnels in which he was first discovered. So, in order to end the game, Link must come full circle, and descend into the same forgotten foundations he had with Zelda in the opening. Here, he can uncover the murals that were obscured during the opening - showing Zelda accompanying Rauru and the Sages, and her transformation into the Light Dragon. This shows that her journey was part of a closed loop - like the game’s logo, the story has come full circle, and will end where it began. The fight against Ganondorf is the game’s true final test - a multi-phase showdown against an opponent who is every bit as skilled as Link. Ganondorf uses a bow, a spear, a club and a sword, can summon phantom clones or projectiles of dark magic, and can even flurry rush - using Link’s signature technique against him. It’s one of my favourite final boss battles in the Zelda series… but it isn’t the game’s last. The Demon Dragon serves the same role as Breath of the Wild’s Dark Beast Ganon - more of a cinematic than an actual fight. The Dragon is not a difficult fight whatsoever, but it’s definitely more involved than its predecessor - and succeeds in being a jaw-dropping set piece to close out the game. Here, in Hyrule’s skies, all three parts of the classic Zelda trio duke it out - the Dragon of Light and the Dragon of Darkness duel, with Link between them. With the Master Sword restored by Zelda, Link is able to destroy Ganondorf for good. The spirits of King Rauru and Queen Sonia appear, and channel their own powers through Link - the irreversible is reversed, and the Light Dragon vanishes: leaving Zelda in its place. This leads to the game’s emotional climax. Tears of the Kingdom had begun with Link failing to catch Zelda - he missed her hand, and she fell into the past. He won’t miss again. This final catch could well have been a cutscene, but giving the player control of Link here is a stroke of genius - and serves to connect the player to the story. I teared up the first time I reached this point - Link and Zelda’s relationship is strong enough to give this moment weight, and make the player want to save her. It’s the perfect way to end the game, and, in retrospect, it couldn’t have ended any other way. The majority of Tears of the Kingdom’s story is really cool: a time-travel loop which shows the very beginning and the very end of Ganondorf’s long war against the Kingdom. There’s clearly been so much of the classic Zelda charm poured into it - from the exceptional design of Rauru, one of my favourite characters in the series, to the heartbreaking sacrifice of one of the game’s most beloved characters. It is a good story, but it is executed poorly. Despite the highs it reaches, I hardly ever felt like I was truly engaging with this story - it often feels like Link is a step removed from the game’s events, rather than a central part of this world. Like with Breath of the Wild’s memories, the Dragon’s Tears can be done in any order - whenever Link encounters one, he unlocks the cutscene specific to that glyph. This means that players will most likely unlock Zelda’s story out of order. This wasn’t much of a problem in Breath of the Wild - at the very beginning of the game, the player understands that Hyrule has fallen, and the spirit of King Rhoam outlines how this happened at the end of the tutorial section. This cutscene is an admittedly clunky way of giving the player all the context they need to begin to engage with the world itself. Recovering Link’s memories adds depth to this story, but that’s it - each memory colours in one part of a story we already know the outline of. Tears of the Kingdom is structured differently - there is no lore dump from the spirit of Hyrule’s old King at the end of the Great Sky Island, leaving the main story, the Imprisoning War, a mystery, and piecing together Zelda’s memories is essential to understand it. This in itself is a bit contrived - it’s never explained why Rauru’s spirit chooses not to explain the Imprisoning War to Link, because he can’t explain it for the story to work in the way the developers want it to. The main mysteries of the game’s plot exist only because Rauru chooses not to explain them here, which is a very unsatisfying way to tell a story. This puts a lot more stress on the Memory style of delivery than was the case in the previous game - they’re still as nonlinear and open as before, but they’re far less optional. Because the main story is delivered this way, it’s possible to interact with it in the wrong way - the Master Sword Geoglyph, found on the slopes of Death Mountain, unlocks the “A Master Sword Through Time'' cutscene for example, in which Mineru explains that draconification is the only way for her to carry the sword to the present day. This can be encountered at any time, and likely will be found relatively early, given its placement on the slopes of Death Mountain, but it spoils the story’s main twist: making what has happened to Zelda obvious. Link uncovering his own memories in Breath of the Wild didn’t change anything in the present- remembering more details surrounding the Great Calamity doesn’t affect anything in the present day. Link is an amnesiac, and has been asleep for a century - so the game’s characters always know more about the story than the player does. This keeps the story of the Great Calamity interesting right up until the very end of the game - the player is always a step behind, desperate to uncover more about the story of this world. But Link uncovering Zelda’s memories in Tears of the Kingdom absolutely should change how he interacts with characters in the present - all of Hyrule is frantically searching for their missing Princess and getting duped by Ganondorf’s phantom, and Link can do nothing to change this - no matter how much he learns about Zelda’s journey, he has no way to tell people about it. The world and the setting remains static, despite him solving the main mystery very early on. The end result is incredibly frustrating - it becomes obvious where Zelda is almost immediately, and the player will figure out that the Zelda in the present is Ganondorf’s puppet as soon as they find the memory near Lurelin Village. The player ends up knowing far more about the story than any of the world’s characters, but is forced to humour them in their charade, constantly being fooled by puppet Zelda and searching for a Princess they will never find. The only exception to the nonlinearity is the final memory, which only becomes available after all others have been unlocked. The Light Dragon appears, and cries a final tear - allowing Link to see her sacrifice, and her transformation. But even unlocking this memory changes nothing in the present - Link now has seen Zelda transform into the Light Dragon, but he can’t tell anyone about it - only Impa, who mumbles something about trying to turn her back, but never does anything about it. Like with most of my criticisms of this game, Tears of the Kingdom’s story suffers because of the game’s complete freedom. Breath of the Wild’s story was designed to fit this open-air style - uncovering how a nation collapsed while exploring what remained. Tears of the Kingdom’s story isn’t designed this way - it tries to break up a more conventional narrative and scatter it around an open world, but this just doesn’t work. Again, the broad strokes of the story are excellent - but the way it is told severely hinders it. We never get enough detail - the player feels completely separate from the main narrative, like Link’s journey is the epilogue to a greater quest we never truly got to take part in. This was true of Breath of the Wild too, of course, but with one major difference: its story is supported by the way the game is designed - uncovering the details of Hyrule’s fall is the point. Every crumbling ruin, every tiny town sheltered away in the wilderness, and Hyrule Castle itself - ground zero, where the scars of the Calamity are the deepest - all tell the game’s story in ways that the memories couldn’t, and support the game’s deliberately broken narrative. Environmental storytelling is what does most of the heavy lifting here - the closer the player looks and the more they think about this world and its ruins, the more the story of the Great Calamity comes to life. The world is designed to tell its own story - by exploring it, Link can decipher the mysteries of the past outside of the game’s main memories and quests. Tears of the Kingdom doesn’t have this luxury. The vast majority of its world is the same Hyrule as before - the ruins of Akkala Citadel, Hyrule Castle, the Great Plateau, Fort Hateno don’t do anything to deepen our understanding of the sequel’s story. And the areas that are new, for the most part lack any of the masterful environmental storytelling of the prequel. The\n",

      "Consolidated Context from ChromaDB: story that has already happened. Tears of the Kingdom, though, was going to be a direct sequel. This game could build on the solid, deep world and lore established by its predecessor, and give us a traditional Zelda story set in the most realistic, believable Hyrule yet. Right? As a direct sequel to Breath of the Wild, the story of Tears of the Kingdom begins a few years after the defeat of Calamity Ganon. During this time, Princess Zelda has begun to rebuild her Kingdom - with the help of Hudson Construction, she oversees the construction of new homes, settlements, and a school for Hyrule’s children. The peace is broken, however, when an insidious substance known as Gloom begins to seep out from beneath Hyrule Castle, poisoning any who come into contact with it. An ancient staircase is discovered leading deep into the Castle’s foundations, and Zelda decides to investigate - accompanied, as always, by her Chosen Knight, Link. The pair journey deep into the bowels of Hyrule Castle - where they eventually discover ancient stonework and statues built by the Zonai, a civilisation mentioned in Hyrule’s earliest records. In a large chamber, they find a set of murals - which appear to depict the founding of the Kingdom of Hyrule and the Imprisoning War that followed shortly afterwards. These murals aren’t only meant to immortalise history, though - they also serve as a warning. The source of the Gloom is found in the next chamber - none other than the body of Ganondorf himself, the Demon King who had waged war in Hyrule’s first days, who has been imprisoned here for thousands of years. As soon as Link and Zelda get close, the seal breaks - the spirit hand holding the Demon King lets him go, dropping a mysterious stone as it does so. Zelda picks the stone up, but before she can examine it - Ganondorf awakens. Though his body is withered, his power is overwhelming - with a surge of Gloom, Ganondorf breaks the Master Sword itself, and cripples Link’s right arm. Another eruption of dark magic collapses the cave - Ganondorf falls into the darkness below… and Zelda falls with him. Though his arm is horrifically scarred, Link leaps after her… and misses. Just as it seems like the Princess will die, the stone she had picked up begins to glow, and she vanishes - having been transported to the distant past. Link is caught by the hand that had sealed Ganondorf, and hauled into the heavens - where he awakens on the Great Sky Island. He soon discovers that Hyrule has changed - the events that followed Ganondorf’s resurrection have become known as the Upheaval. Floating islands covered in Zonai Ruins have appeared in the skies all across Hyrule, and ancient stonework has rained down on the Kingdom below them. Chasms leading down into the Depths have torn apart Hyrule’s surface, and Hyrule Castle itself now floats, ominously, above its own Chasm. Monsters have returned in force to terrorise the Kingdom’s people, and Hyrule’s main races are each affected by their own Regional Phenomena. Strange glyphs have appeared on Hyrule’s surface - glowing shapes that can only be seen from high above. But, most troubling of all… Princess Zelda is missing. The spirit of Rauru, the first King of Hyrule, tells Link that it was his hand that had sealed Ganondorf, and that he has managed to save Link’s right arm by fusing it with his own. Link has been severely weakened by the attack, however - his blade has been broken, and his body ravaged by the Gloom. In order to restore his lost vitality, he must bathe himself in the sacred Light of the Zonai Shrines - each purging some of the darkness that remains within him, and restoring power to his right arm. After obtaining the Ultrahand, Fuse and Ascend abilities he can access the Temple of Time, where he meets with a ghostly projection of Zelda. Wordlessly, the Princess reaches out, and grants him the Recall ability, which, after the fourth tutorial Shrine, Link uses to send the broken Master Sword back in time. With that, Link is set free into Hyrule once again - to uncover the truth of Zelda’s disappearance, to free the four races from their plights, and to defeat the newly awakened Ganondorf. Like with Breath of the Wild, most of Tears of the Kingdom’s story takes place in the past. The present is very static - there are of course a ton of characterful sidequests, the main Regional Phenomena quests, and the main battle against Ganondorf himself, but that’s it. All of the context for the game’s events, anything actually interesting, is locked in the past - experienced not by Link, the player, but Zelda, through cutscenes. Link can uncover Zelda’s story with the Geoglyphs on Hyrule’s surface - each of which contains a Dragon’s Tear, which, by interacting with Link’s Recall ability, will unlock a cutscene showing part of her journey in the distant past. Tears of the Kingdom’s story is the story of Princess Zelda. After being transported from deep below the castle, she finds herself out in the open air, in the Kingdom of Hyrule… but not the Hyrule she knows. She meets Rauru and Sonia, who introduce themselves as Hyrule’s King and Queen, and invite her to stay with them at the castle. These are Hyrule’s first rulers - the couple that began the Royal Family, making Zelda their distant descendent - the powers within her bloodline began with these two. King Rauru holds the power of light - a power that can repel or destroy evil, which is implied to be the reason for Zelda’s sealing power used to defeat the Calamity. And Queen Sonia holds power over time - she can manipulate its flow. The reason Zelda travelled back here was because she picked up Rauru’s Secret Stone - a Zonai artefact designed to amplify the abilities of whoever wields it. This particular stone originally amplified Rauru’s Light powers and helped him to keep Ganondorf imprisoned, but once picked up by Zelda, it began to amplify her own Time powers inherited from Sonia - and so, when faced with certain death, it was Zelda’s own power that saved her, and transported her to the past. Zelda is faced with an impossible challenge - to return to the present, where she knows that a terrible threat has awakened, and Link is injured. But she doesn’t yet know how to control her powers - she is trapped here. And the past isn’t any safer than the present - Zelda has travelled back to the earliest days of the Imprisoning War that was marked on the stone murals - Ganondorf, the King of the Gerudo Tribe, aims to take control of the land from Rauru, and rule Hyrule himself. Throughout the memories, we see Zelda train her time powers, in hopes that she will be able to use them to return home. She spends time with the Royal Couple, as well as Mineru, the King’s sister - though she is trapped in this time against her will, she falls in love with these characters. Zelda lost her mother when she was only six years old, and her father, King Rhoam, died during the Great Calamity. So, in essence, King Rauru and Queen Sonia fill this parental role: they are her own blood, and they care for her like she is their child. Though she is thousands of years removed from her own time… the past becomes a second home. And so, when the Imprisoning War breaks out, Zelda is as affected by it as anyone else. She is appointed the Sage of Time by Rauru, who gives out Zonai Secret Stones to the leaders of Hyrule’s four races, and faces the Demon King alongside them. After the final battle, the one the player will see five times in cutscenes following the main dungeons, Zelda is at a loss. Rauru is gone, Mineru is wounded, and Zelda is still stuck in the past - desperate to find her purpose here, and a way to get home. And then… a golden light appears just outside of the Temple of Time, and from it… the broken Master Sword appears. Through Zelda’s time powers, Link’s Recall power, or a combination of the two, the Master Sword was able to travel back to the distant past - into Zelda’s hands. With this, she understands. It had been her own powers that had caused her to travel to the past, and now she knows why: she must play a critical role in the battle against the Demon King, and deliver her Knight the weapon which could undo him. She must bathe the Master Sword in her own Light power, to restore it, and to imbue it with enough sacred force to repel Ganondorf. But like Mineru had said, there was only one way to live long enough to see the present day: the forbidden act of draconification. Zelda’s sacrifice is Tears of the Kingdom’s defining moment, and it’s one of the most impactful story beats in the series. Although she is using an artefact created by the godlike Zonai for a good reason, it feels… wrong: Zelda’s reaction to swallowing the stone is heartbreaking - she is giving up her autonomy, her life, her soul in order to save her Kingdom. Her final words are spoken to Link, but they describe her own motivations: she is Hyrule’s Princess, and she is willing to give everything to protect her people. The Light Dragon is visible right from the beginning of Link’s adventure - it circles the Great Sky Island during the tutorial, and breaks the Cloud Barrier obscuring the Surface. It’s been here, high above the clouds, for thousands upon thousands of years - Zelda has watched over the entirety of this Hyrule’s history, silently waiting for the time she knows as the present, and for her Chosen Knight. This makes Tears of the Kingdom’s Master Sword pull one of the very best in the whole Zelda series. This is always among the most defining moments of every game - Link finally discovers the legendary blade of evil’s bane, and pulls it to symbolise the completion of his transformation into the Hero. This time, he pulls the blade from the head of the Light Dragon, Zelda herself. The gravity of what she has done so that this sword could reach Link makes this moment so impactful - Zelda has given everything, and now the final battle falls on Link. Speaking of the final battle… Tears of the Kingdom’s ending could well be the game at its absolute strongest. Like with Breath of the Wild, the ending of the game can be accessed without completing any of the main quests - Ganondorf lurks deep below Hyrule Castle, even deeper into the tunnels in which he was first discovered. So, in order to end the game, Link must come full circle, and descend into the same forgotten foundations he had with Zelda in the opening. Here, he can uncover the murals that were obscured during the opening - showing Zelda accompanying Rauru and the Sages, and her transformation into the Light Dragon. This shows that her journey was part of a closed loop - like the game’s logo, the story has come full circle, and will end where it began. The fight against Ganondorf is the game’s true final test - a multi-phase showdown against an opponent who is every bit as skilled as Link. Ganondorf uses a bow, a spear, a club and a sword, can summon phantom clones or projectiles of dark magic, and can even flurry rush - using Link’s signature technique against him. It’s one of my favourite final boss battles in the Zelda series… but it isn’t the game’s last. The Demon Dragon serves the same role as Breath of the Wild’s Dark Beast Ganon - more of a cinematic than an actual fight. The Dragon is not a difficult fight whatsoever, but it’s definitely more involved than its predecessor - and succeeds in being a jaw-dropping set piece to close out the game. Here, in Hyrule’s skies, all three parts of the classic Zelda trio duke it out - the Dragon of Light and the Dragon of Darkness duel, with Link between them. With the Master Sword restored by Zelda, Link is able to destroy Ganondorf for good. The spirits of King Rauru and Queen Sonia appear, and channel their own powers through Link - the irreversible is reversed, and the Light Dragon vanishes: leaving Zelda in its place. This leads to the game’s emotional climax. Tears of the Kingdom had begun with Link failing to catch Zelda - he missed her hand, and she fell into the past. He won’t miss again. This final catch could well have been a cutscene, but giving the player control of Link here is a stroke of genius - and serves to connect the player to the story. I teared up the first time I reached this point - Link and Zelda’s relationship is strong enough to give this moment weight, and make the player want to save her. It’s the perfect way to end the game, and, in retrospect, it couldn’t have ended any other way. The majority of Tears of the Kingdom’s story is really cool: a time-travel loop which shows the very beginning and the very end of Ganondorf’s long war against the Kingdom. There’s clearly been so much of the classic Zelda charm poured into it - from the exceptional design of Rauru, one of my favourite characters in the series, to the heartbreaking sacrifice of one of the game’s most beloved characters. It is a good story, but it is executed poorly. Despite the highs it reaches, I hardly ever felt like I was truly engaging with this story - it often feels like Link is a step removed from the game’s events, rather than a central part of this world. Like with Breath of the Wild’s memories, the Dragon’s Tears can be done in any order - whenever Link encounters one, he unlocks the cutscene specific to that glyph. This means that players will most likely unlock Zelda’s story out of order. This wasn’t much of a problem in Breath of the Wild - at the very beginning of the game, the player understands that Hyrule has fallen, and the spirit of King Rhoam outlines how this happened at the end of the tutorial section. This cutscene is an admittedly clunky way of giving the player all the context they need to begin to engage with the world itself. Recovering Link’s memories adds depth to this story, but that’s it - each memory colours in one part of a story we already know the outline of. Tears of the Kingdom is structured differently - there is no lore dump from the spirit of Hyrule’s old King at the end of the Great Sky Island, leaving the main story, the Imprisoning War, a mystery, and piecing together Zelda’s memories is essential to understand it. This in itself is a bit contrived - it’s never explained why Rauru’s spirit chooses not to explain the Imprisoning War to Link, because he can’t explain it for the story to work in the way the developers want it to. The main mysteries of the game’s plot exist only because Rauru chooses not to explain them here, which is a very unsatisfying way to tell a story. This puts a lot more stress on the Memory style of delivery than was the case in the previous game - they’re still as nonlinear and open as before, but they’re far less optional. Because the main story is delivered this way, it’s possible to interact with it in the wrong way - the Master Sword Geoglyph, found on the slopes of Death Mountain, unlocks the “A Master Sword Through Time'' cutscene for example, in which Mineru explains that draconification is the only way for her to carry the sword to the present day. This can be encountered at any time, and likely will be found relatively early, given its placement on the slopes of Death Mountain, but it spoils the story’s main twist: making what has happened to Zelda obvious. Link uncovering his own memories in Breath of the Wild didn’t change anything in the present- remembering more details surrounding the Great Calamity doesn’t affect anything in the present day. Link is an amnesiac, and has been asleep for a century - so the game’s characters always know more about the story than the player does. This keeps the story of the Great Calamity interesting right up until the very end of the game - the player is always a step behind, desperate to uncover more about the story of this world. But Link uncovering Zelda’s memories in Tears of the Kingdom absolutely should change how he interacts with characters in the present - all of Hyrule is frantically searching for their missing Princess and getting duped by Ganondorf’s phantom, and Link can do nothing to change this - no matter how much he learns about Zelda’s journey, he has no way to tell people about it. The world and the setting remains static, despite him solving the main mystery very early on. The end result is incredibly frustrating - it becomes obvious where Zelda is almost immediately, and the player will figure out that the Zelda in the present is Ganondorf’s puppet as soon as they find the memory near Lurelin Village. The player ends up knowing far more about the story than any of the world’s characters, but is forced to humour them in their charade, constantly being fooled by puppet Zelda and searching for a Princess they will never find. The only exception to the nonlinearity is the final memory, which only becomes available after all others have been unlocked. The Light Dragon appears, and cries a final tear - allowing Link to see her sacrifice, and her transformation. But even unlocking this memory changes nothing in the present - Link now has seen Zelda transform into the Light Dragon, but he can’t tell anyone about it - only Impa, who mumbles something about trying to turn her back, but never does anything about it. Like with most of my criticisms of this game, Tears of the Kingdom’s story suffers because of the game’s complete freedom. Breath of the Wild’s story was designed to fit this open-air style - uncovering how a nation collapsed while exploring what remained. Tears of the Kingdom’s story isn’t designed this way - it tries to break up a more conventional narrative and scatter it around an open world, but this just doesn’t work. Again, the broad strokes of the story are excellent - but the way it is told severely hinders it. We never get enough detail - the player feels completely separate from the main narrative, like Link’s journey is the epilogue to a greater quest we never truly got to take part in. This was true of Breath of the Wild too, of course, but with one major difference: its story is supported by the way the game is designed - uncovering the details of Hyrule’s fall is the point. Every crumbling ruin, every tiny town sheltered away in the wilderness, and Hyrule Castle itself - ground zero, where the scars of the Calamity are the deepest - all tell the game’s story in ways that the memories couldn’t, and support the game’s deliberately broken narrative. Environmental storytelling is what does most of the heavy lifting here - the closer the player looks and the more they think about this world and its ruins, the more the story of the Great Calamity comes to life. The world is designed to tell its own story - by exploring it, Link can decipher the mysteries of the past outside of the game’s main memories and quests. Tears of the Kingdom doesn’t have this luxury. The vast majority of its world is the same Hyrule as before - the ruins of Akkala Citadel, Hyrule Castle, the Great Plateau, Fort Hateno don’t do anything to deepen our understanding of the sequel’s story. And the areas that are new, for the most part lack any of the masterful environmental storytelling of the prequel. The Great Sky Island has the most story of any of them. It was known as the Garden of Time during the time of King Rauru, a peaceful, tranquil grove in the shadow of the ancient Temple of Time. We’re told by the Construct atop this Temple that the entire Great Sky Island was once found on the surface - which we see in Zelda’s memories - this ancient Temple of Time is found in the same place as the newer, Hyrulean Temple of Time in the present. This means that the Great Sky Island was once in roughly the same place as the Great Plateau - which we know was the heart of Rauru’s Kingdom, and the site of his Hyrule Castle. Now, the Garden of Time is in ruins - we see the foundations of what could have been houses or abbeys. There’s a melancholic feeling here, one of the decaying ruin of something majestic, of glory days that are now gone, never to return. The Temple of Time’s bell, one which once dictated the daily lives of Rauru’s people, now echoes across an empty Plateau, heard only by the Constructs which live on without their masters. The Great Sky Island having this backstory gives deeper meaning to the areas Link explores, and connects him with Hyrule’s history. Because we know what this place once was, it allows us to theorise and wonder about the ruins that remain - this stone arch might have been the gate to the Garden of Time, or these ruined buildings might have been homes for servants or priests who worked in the Temple. But the same can’t be said for the other Sky Islands. Forge Island was, well, a forge, the Thunderhead Isles were probably designed as an entrance to the Spirit Temple, but the vast majority of the Sky Islands lack anything interesting whatsoever - most are incredibly similar ruins of nondescript Zonai buildings, islands designed around accessing a Shrine, with absolutely nothing in the way of story. And the same is true for the Depths. Again, there are broad strokes here - we can tell from the Abandoned Mines that the Zonai used the Depths to gather Zonaite, and stations for vehicle parts show how these ancient people once traversed this underground land. But there’s nothing deeper than this - like the Sky Islands above, the structures in the Depths are too repetitive and too mundane to act as a crutch for the game’s story, like the ruins of Hyrule did on the surface before. The exception to this is the Yiga Clan Hideouts. Master Kohga was defeated by Link during Breath of the Wild, after falling down a seemingly bottomless pit. This pit did have a bottom, though - Kohga fell into the Depths. He had accidentally found an entire new world - and so, in the years between Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, his followers have been exploring the Depths - experimenting with ancient Zonai machinery and building base camps in the darkness. Each Hideout features a journal of notes the Yiga expeditionaries have made about their time in the Depths. These range from funny, like how one writer hopes to find shadow bananas in the Faron Depths, to genuinely disturbing, like how Bargainer Statues have been stealing their souls. Having a bit of story to the Yiga Hideouts immediately makes them more characterful than the countless Zonai Ruins, and so much more memorable. But, overall, Tears of the Kingdom’s worldbuilding feels incredibly shallow in comparison\n",
